...course. Today, we will discuss mantra seven. Yesterday, we discussed mantra
six, which talked about equal vision. So let us look at this section first and
then we will go into the mantra. So this is the second section of the Isopanisad
which is talking about understand ishvara by spiritual vision. So in that,
mantras four and five, first talking about how through our normal vision and
normal level of consciousness, ishvara is inconceivable.

And then, before we can understand Ishvara, we need to develop spiritual vision
towards the things, people and events of this world. So, that is the second
section, six, seven, and with this spiritual vision, then we will be able to
apply spiritual vision towards the Supreme Lord. So, this is the last part,
seventh verse of the second subsection within the second section of the
Isopanisad. So let us look at the verse:

        yasmin sarvāṇi bhūtāny
        ātmaivābhūd vijānataḥ
        tatra ko mohaḥ kaḥ śoka
        ekatvam anupaśyataḥ

"yasmin", that person, so this is a continuation of the thread of thoughts from
the previous verse. "yasmin", that person was mentioned in the last verse also.
"sarvāṇi bhūtāny", all living beings, "ātmaivābhūd vijānataḥ", "vijānataḥ" means
to know, know systematically, especially, visesa, vi is the prefix "vijānataḥ",
how does the person know all living beings? "ātmaivābhūd", one sees them at a
spiritual platform, one sees all living beings as spiritual. Now, "tatra ko
mohaḥ kaḥ śoka", for such a person, what is the mohah? What is the soka? What is
the illusion? What is the lamentation? Why there is no, no mohah, lamentation,
because "ekatvam anupaśyataḥ", such a person sees oneness and "anupaśyataḥ", we
discussed the word "anupaśyataḥ" was there in the previous verse also.

        yas tu sarvāṇi bhūtāny
        ātmany evānupaśyati
        sarva-bhūteṣu cātmānaṁ
        tato na vijugupsate

So, "ātmany evānupaśyati", so in both these mantras, the emphasize is on seeing
with knowledge, "anupaśyataḥ". So let us look at the translation:

"One who always sees all living entities as spiritual sparks", "ātmaivābhūd",
now Srila Prabhupada explains what that "ātmaivābhūd", not only the purport, but
also in translation... in quality one with the Lord, becomes a true knower of
things. What, then, can be illusion or anxiety for him? "tatra ko mohaḥ kaḥ
śoka".

Now, the purport in, we divided into five distinct sections with the... The
whole purport is basically an elaboration on ekatvam. Because the word ekatvam
is like a feast for the impersonalist. And the Upanishads are generally
considered to be books that talk about impersonalism. And that is why
the impersonalists use them a lot, however, the Upanishads also talk about
personal features of the Absolute Truth, although they are not the emphasize,
they are talked about.

So, Srila Prabhupada is elaborating on the concept of ekatvam, based on the
broader understanding of the Vedic scriptures. Because here just the word
ekatvam comes, oneness. But what does oneness mean actually?

So, Srila Prabhupada will explain this, firstly, he talks about energy and
energetic, and he uses the example of fire, and heat and light. Then, he uses
that oneness, the energy and energetic are one, but entirely different also.
What is the difference? With respect to drop and ocean. The drop is one in
quality, but is different in quantity.

And then Srila Prabhupada uses the example of how the oneness is actually not
just in quality, but is also in interest. It is inclinations and desires, and
intentions. So he uses the example of family. Every member in the family is
different, but all of them are united in their interest. And in a country, every
citizen is individual, but at the same time, the nation is united as one
cohesive whole. So like that, oneness and interest. Now, when the family is
united together, then the family will be happy. But if every individual wants to
pursue his or her own interest and does not care for others, then the family
will be chaotic.

So, Prabhupada says, similarly, in the spiritual realm also, when everbody
becomes one in interest, then there is enjoyment. And then, that is the point
elaborated in the next paragraph. That is separate interests cause shoka and
moha because lamentation and illusion. And therefore the conclusion is that we
should become one in interest with God. We should do, make the will of God as
our own will.

Now, let us look at these themes one by one.

So, complete realisation of ekatvam has two aspects. First is that we realise
our oneness with the Absolute Truth in quality. Now, when that happens, it
brings detachment. Why? Because when I understand that I am not jarda tattva,
I am not matter, I am citkana, I am spirit, I am conscious beings, then I
understand that the dead matter cannot give me happiness, and temporary things
will only cause me misery because I am eternal. So, when I understand that I am
different from matter, because I am in quality one with the Absolute, aham
brahmasmi, at that time, I become detached from matter. Because now I
understand that matter cannot give me happiness because matter is unconscious,
matter is temporary. I am conscious. I am eternal. I should seek happiness at
the spiritual level, so therefore, realising that I am spiritual, I am in one
quality with the Absolute Truth is desirable, but it is not the complete
realisation.

One subordination in quantity to the Absolute Truth brings humility. So, if I
just think that I am spirit, that will bring pride, especially when I consider
that, oh, all the other people are attached, I am detached, that can bring
pride. But when I understand, yes, I am spirit, but there is a Supreme Spirit.
And I am tiny. I am amsa of that spirit. So subordination in quantity to the
Absolute Truth brings humility.

So, on the impersonal path, the oneness in quality is emphasized that aham
brahmasmi, aham brahmasmi, aham brahmasmi, whereas on the path of devotion, the
subordination in quantity is emphasized. Caitanya Mahaprabhu told Sanatan
Goswami "jivere swarup hoy, krishnera nitya das", that we are the servants of
Krishna is the primary emphasis of the devotees. The devotees also know that we
are not the body, we are the soul. But the soul is not just some formless
spirit. The soul has a real living relationship with the Absolute Truth, and
that relationship is based on love and service. So when we understand that God
is great and I am small, and my smallness is not just at the material level,
even at a spiritual level, I am small. That brings humility.

So, detachment and humility, both are important, but if detachment alone comes
first and that is the primary focus, if the exclusive focus, then the detachment
leads to pride. On other hand, if humility comes first, I am not the enjoyer, I
am the servant, and let me serve, then that service gives a higher taste. And
when that higher taste leads to detachment, that detachment does not bring
pride, because already, the foundation of humility has been established based on
the knowledge that I am the servant of God. We see in the Siksastakam, Caitanya
Mahaprabhu emphasizes this progression when he says in the third verse humility.

        tṛṇād api sunīcena
        taror api sahiṣṇunā
        amāninā mānadena
        kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ

So be humbler than a blade of grass, be more tolerant than a tree. These are
examples of humility in classic sense. So he first recommends humility, exalts
humility, and then he talks about detachment.

        na dhanaḿ na janaḿ na sundarīḿ
        kavitāḿ vā jagad-īśa kāmaye
        mama janmani janmanīśvare
        bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi

So, the conclusion of both these verses is advance mean towards devotion. It is
third verse concludes with "kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ", which is advancing towards
the devotion, and fourth concludes with "ahaitukī tvayi".

So, both are talking about progress in devotion, but first humility, then
humility ... 10:18
