Hare Krishna.

So, we continue with our discussion on the Isopanisad. We are discussing about
sambhuti and vinasa. So, mantra twelwe said that when a person worships the
asambhuti, that person "andhaṁ tamaḥ praviśanti", goes into darkness. And person
who worships so called sam..., asam..., sambhuti, so called sambhuti, that means
a concocted conception of the Absolute Truth. That person goes into deeper
darkness. Now, this verse is going to contrast the two. It says one result is
obtained by worship of sambhuti, and another by the result of a..., by the
worship of asambhuti. So, let us lo..., look at this verse. So, it is said:

        anyad evāhuḥ sambhavād
        anyad āhur asambhavāt
        iti śuśruma dhīrāṇāṁ
        ye nas tad vicacakṣire

So, "anyad evāhuḥ sambhavād", "āhuḥ" means it is said. Certainly, "evā", by them
it is said. "anyad", one, one particular. "sambhavād", by the worship of
"sambhavād", by the worship of the eternal, one result is obtained. 

"anyad āhur asambhavāt", by the worship of that, which is not eternal, some
other result is obtained. "iti śuśruma dhīrāṇāṁ", this is what I have heared
from the "dhīrā", "śuśruma dhīrā". "ye nas tad vicacakṣire", those who have
perfectly explained it. So:

"It is said that one result is obtained by worshiping the supreme cause of all
causes and that another result is obtained by worshiping what is not supreme.
All this is heard from the undisturbed authorities, who clearly explained it."

Who clearly explained it. So, now, let us look at Srila Prabhupada's purport.
So, basically, this, now, Srila Prabhupada is giving little longer purports, in,
for these mantras. So, there are sixteen paragraphs in this purport.

So, first thing Srila Prabhupada says is this verse clearly says different paths
lead to different results. One p..., one path, one result, another path, another
result. So, therefore "dhīrā" exposes folly of "all paths lead to the same
goal". And analysing this will be the main theme of the purport and the class.

So, after exposing the folly of that, then "dhīrā" teaches shastra. What does
shastra say? Different paths lead to different goals. So, we have to choose the
right path and then we get to the right goal.

Then, accept Krishna as sambhavat. So, what are, what are the paths now? One is
that we accept Krishna as the Absolute Truth. Then, what will happen? Yes.
This is what Arjuna did. And then Arjuna, what did Prabhupada say? He killed his
so called relatives to satisfy Krishna. That means for the satisfaction of
Krishna, one is ready to do anything. No. If somebody does not accept Krishna as
sambhavat. Then, the person may choose an entirely different course of action.
What is the course of action? People are my God, somebody may say. As we
discussed, mana seva, madhava sevaya. We will discuss elaborately. Or I am God.
That is Mayavada. Which we discussed earlier also. We will discuss it little bit
today also.

Now, hearing from "dhīrā" helps one and all to attain perfection.

So, let us look over these points now. Firstly, do all paths lead to the same
goal? We will look at this from a logical point of view, from the scriptural
point of view, and then from the practical point of view, the cultural point of
view. So, now, Srila Prabhupada standard example for refuting st..., this was
that if one sits, say, in Mumbai, one train is going to Chennai. Another is
going to Delhi. Another is going to Calcutta. So, now, will it be that all the
trains will lead to the same destination? No. Because actually they are all,
trains going in different directions. So, similarly, Srila Prabhupada says, how
can all paths lead to the same goal? These paths are different. And these paths
take people in different directions. The impersonalists may refute that this is
a wrong example because, actually, do you say the, do, do you think that the
Absolute Truth is limited, like one small place, like Delhi, or Calcutta, or
Chennai. The Absolute Truth is everywhere. The Absolute Truth is in Delhi also,
Calcutta also, Chennai also. So, therefore, this is a false example. Now, the,
when the impersonalists say like this, they are actually not understanding the
thrust of the e..., example. The thrust of the example is not whether the
Absolute Truth is limited or unlimited. The thrust is whether the, the path to
the Absolute Truth is a particular path or by doing anything in life, one can go
to the Absolute Truth. Just one have to evolve one's consciousness in a
particular way, so that one can go the Absolute Truth.

You know, for example, Srila Prabhupada was asked this question once in America
after University programme. Swamiji, I do not know the verse, but I have heard
that the Bhagavad Gita says whatever we do, ultimately, we will go back to God.
So, Srila Prabhupada replied, if whatever we do, we, we have to go back to God,
then why would God have to speak the Bhagavad Gita? We would do whatever we
wanted to do and we would go back to Him. But Krishna speaks Bhagavad Gita, in
which He tells this. If you do this, this will happen. If you do this, this will
happen.

        mac-cittaḥ sarva-durgāṇi
        mat-prasādāt tariṣyasi
        atha cet tvam ahaṅkārān
        na śroṣyasi vinaṅkṣyasi

Krishna says if you become conscious of me, in 18.58, you will cross over all
obstacles by my grace. If, however, you do not become conscious of me, you will
be lost. So, Krishna is clearly telling two paths, two consequences. So, Krishna
does not teach this. So, yes, it is true that the Absolute Truth is unlimited.
But that does not mean whatever we do, we will go to the Absolute Truth. Why?
Because the Absolute Truth is perceived at a particular level of Consciousness.
The Ab..., if our consciousness is not tuned to that level, then although the
Absolute Truth is all pervading, we cannot perceive the Absolute Truth. So,
f..., there are three modes of material nature. There is ignorance, passion and
goodness. And beyond that, there is transcendence. So, only for consciousness,
and moving towards transcendence can we perceive transcendental reality.
Otherwise, transcendental reality will remain inaccessible to us. So, the thrust
of the example is not the nature of the destination. The, the thrust of the
example is the reality that different paths are going to take us to different
kinds of consciousness. And not all kinds of consciousness are equal when it
comes to perceiving, realising, or relishing the Absolu..., the presence of the
Absolute Truth. And this is not just based on logic. This is also based on
scripture. Before we go to scripture, to understand that the Absolute Truth is
ultimately a person. And when we talk about a person. When we want to go close
to a person, then there are certain things which we have to do. Now, if I
want to go clo..., become closer to my spouse, then I know what his or her likes
and dislikes are, and accordingly change my behavior. Similarly, the Supreme
Lord is a person. And relationships require commitment. Krishna is the Supreme
Person, then actually, if we people work so hard to try to win the favor of some
ordinary person. How much more we need to strive to win the, to c..., form a
relationship with the Supreme Person? Supreme Lord is very merciful, very
accessible. But still, He is a person. And He needs to, He needs to be
approached as a person. And approaching Him as a person means that we understand
what are His likes and dislikes, and act accordingly. Now, Krishna's likes and
dislikes are not arbitrary. At, as far as the principles of devotional service
are concerned, at least with respesct to purification of a consciousness from
the lower modes to the higher modes. What Krishna likes, it is also for our
ultimate good. That the more we do the things that are pleasing to Krishna, the
more we become purified, elevated. And we become happier. And ultimately, we get
liberated.

So, now, let us look at the scriptural refere..., now, it, the scriptures use,
if, if the scriptures are going to say that all paths lead to the same goal,
then the scriptures would not use repeated instruction by contrast. Instruction
by contrast means that the scriptures tell, if you do this, this will happen.
And that, that, that will happen. Now, thus, this has been done in the
Isopanisad itself. This particular mantra that we are taking. You know, it was
preceded by similar mantra earlier with respect to vidya and avidya.

        anyad evāhuḥ sambhavād
        anyad āhur asambhavāt

        anyad evāhur vidyayā-
        nyad āhur avidyayā

So, just like it was, here it was, sambhavat and asambhavat. So, the Isopanisad
makes it clear. If you do this, this will, going to happen. If you do this, this is
going to be happen. So, similarly, in the Bhagavad Gita, so many occasions. We
just look at a few occasions over here. So, in the third chapter and fourth
chapter, Krishna is talking about faith. And in 31, 32, He says, that if you
have faith, what will happen. If you do not have faith, what will happen. In 31,
He says:

        ye me matam idaṁ nityam
        anutiṣṭhanti mānavāḥ
        śraddhāvanto ’nasūyanto
        mucyante te ’pi karmabhiḥ

He says if you have faith in me and follow my instructions, you will become free
from all sinful reactions. Now, the other hand, in 32, He says:

        ye tv etad abhyasūyanto
        nānutiṣṭhanti me matam
        sarva-jñāna-vimūḍhāṁs tān
        viddhi naṣṭān acetasaḥ

If you, if one is envious of me, one does not have faith in me, then whatever
knowledge one acquires, that will all be lost. Why? Because the consciousness is
misdirected. So, Krishna is clear in it, two paths, two consequences. And
similarly, 4.39-40 also, Krishna says something similar. In 39, first He says
what will happen by faith.

        śraddhāvāḻ labhate jñānaṁ
        tat-paraḥ saṁyatendriyaḥ
        jñānaṁ labdhvā parāṁ śāntim
        acireṇādhigacchati

He says, if you have "śraddhā", "labhate jñānaṁ". You will get "jñāna". And
"jñāna" will lead to "parāṁ śāntim". "acireṇādhigacchati", you will get supreme
peace. And quickly you will get. Now, on the o..., on the other hand, He says,
if one does not have faith:

        ajñaś cāśraddadhānaś ca
        saṁśayātmā vinaśyati
        nāyaṁ loko ’sti na paro
        na sukhaṁ saṁśayātmanaḥ

He says that if one does not have faith, one will get happiness neither in this
world, nor in the next world. And then, after that, in 16.23-24, He talks about
one who follows shastra and one who does not follow shastra. So, first, He says,
in, one who does not follow shastra. So, in 31, 3.31 and 4.39, He told the
positive first, and the negative later. But in 16.23 and 24, first, He tells the
positive. And then He tells the negative. So, f..., sorry, first, He tells the
negative, and then He tells the positive. In twenty..., in 23, He first says,
those who do not follow shastra.

        yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya
        vartate kāma-kārataḥ
        na sa siddhim avāpnoti
        na sukhaṁ na parāṁ gatim

So, one who gives up shastra and "vartate kāma-kārataḥ", act only out of their
own selfish desires. "na sa siddhim avāpnoti", they will get no "siddhi". They
will not attain perfection. "na sukhaṁ", they will not get happiness. "na parāṁ
gatim", nor will they ever get the supreme destination. Now, and therefore,
Krishna says this is not the path that you should follow. What is the path you
should follow?

        tasmāc chāstraṁ pramāṇaṁ te
        kāryākārya-vyavasthitau
        jñātvā śāstra-vidhānoktaṁ
        karma kartum ihārhasi

Therefore, oh, Arjuna, "tasmāc chāstraṁ pramāṇaṁ te", understand what is
"chāstraṁ". And "kāryākārya-vyavasthitau". Understand what is the "kāryā" to be
done. What is the "kāryā" not to be done. "jñātvā śāstra-vidhānoktaṁ",
understanding what is the "vidhāno śāstra". "karma kartum ihārhasi". Act
accordingly. And 18.58, we already discussed. Now, let us look at 9.25. This is
an important verse from the Bhagavad Gita which talks about, we discussed this
briefly earlier. But we will discuss it once again. 9.25 is:

        yānti deva-vratā devān
        pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ
        bhūtāni yānti bhūtejyā
        yānti mad-yājino ’pi mām

That, one who worships the devatas goes to devatas. This is actually talking
about overall goodness worship. Good, you now, "yān...", "pitṝn", "bhūtāni yānti
bhūtejyā", He says, as far as "pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ", those who worship in
the mode of passion, they worship the ancestors, they go to the ancestors. The
worship, those who worship in the ignorance, that is "bhūtās", they go to the
"bhūtās". And those who worship me come to me. So, Krishna is in one verse
giving four different trajectories. What can be clearer? What can be more
unambiguous? It is very very clear what Krishna is telling over here. He is
telling that different paths will lead to different goals. All paths do not lead
to the same goal. So, where does this idea that all paths lead to the same goal
come from? It comes from a desire to try to simplify complex issues. Simplify,
or, z..., now s..., not simplify, actually, to try to water down complexity and
try to make things simple. Now, even when those things are not simple. When one
tries to artifically make them simple, it leads to misunderstanding. Certainly,
things should not be made more complicated than what they are. But at the same
time, we cannot make things artifically simplistic. So, student has to evolve.
But teachers should not make things more complex than what they are. But a KG
student cannot understand calculus. And if a, if say, doctorate level, or senior
college level calculus has to be studied, the student has to evolve. You cannot
simplify the subject beyond a particular level. The truths themselves are
complex. So, it could be a simplistic wish of people that actually, you know,
all paths, whatever you want to do. You follow that path. I follow my path. We
will all be happy. There will be no conflict. So, this desire is good.

So, now, but this desire may be good. But it just does not work. So, we will
look at the cultural nature of this desire. But let us look at one more verse,
which is often used by the impersonalists to support, to support the idea that
all paths lead to the same goal. This is Gita 4.11. Now, many impersonalists
interpret it to say all paths lead to the same goal. However, what the verse
actually says is all people are on my path. It does not say that paths lead to
the same goal. Let us look at this verse, this 4.11:

        ye yathā māṁ prapadyante
        tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham
        mama vartmānuvartante
        manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ

So, it is interesting that Srila Prabhupada quotes more of 4.11 A and B. A and B
is:

        ye yathā māṁ prapadyante
        tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham

He quotes more of "ye yathā māṁ prapadyante", as all people surrender unto me, I
reward them accordingly. So, he focuses on this principle of reciprocation. And
when we study the Bhagavad Gita, we will look at this verse in much more detail.
But suffice it to say the emphasize of this verse is what? That Krishna is
reciprocal. If somebody surrenders to Him with pure devotion, He rewards that
person eternal destination. If somebody reci..., d..., surr..., approaches Him
with the material motivation, Krishna reciprocates accordingly giving him
whatever that person desires. So, that, that is the thrust which Srila
Prabhupada uses. Now, Mayavadis thrust the next part. What is the next part?

        mama vartmānuvartante

That "mama vartmānuvartante", "mama" is mine, "vartmā" is path. "ānuvartante" is
to follow. "manuṣyāḥ", people. "pārtha sarvaśaḥ", so all people, oh, "Pārtha".
so "sarvaśaḥ", "manuṣyāḥ", "mama vartmānuvartante", all people, oh, "Pārtha",
follow my path. So, as Prabhupada translates it.

"Everyone follows My path in all respects."

So, now, actually speaking, this verse really cannot be interpreted to mean all
people are on my path. Sorry, that all paths lead to the same goal. Because if
we look at the verse, what does it say? The "sarvaśaḥ" is clearly applied to
"manuṣyāḥ". It is not applied to "vartmā". It is not talking about all paths. It
is talking about all people. All people are on my people. "mama vartmā". It is
not "sarvaśaḥ vartmā". My path, all people. So, Krishna is not saying all paths
followed by all people will come to me. He is saying all people are on my path.
Now, what does it mean when we say all people are on my path? That is a very
profound truth. Actually, different people are attracted to different things in
the world. So, materialistic people are attracted to materially good-looking
t..., good-looking or good-feeling things. Religious people are attracted to
different devatas. Atheistic people are attracted to their own intellectual
ideas about atheism. Drunkards are attracted to alcohol. Sports lovers are
attracted sports. Devotees are attracted to Krishna. Now, all these people have
different things that they are attracted to. But actually, whatever a person is
attracted to, that attractiveness is ultimately a spark of Krishna's
all-attractiveness. Krishna talks about this in 10.41 in the Bhagavad Gita that:

    yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ
    śrīmad ūrjitam eva vā
    tat tad evāvagaccha tvaṁ
    mama tejo-’ṁśa-sambhavam

He says that all opulent, beautiful, glorious creation spring from, but a spark
of My splendor. So, Krishna says over here that actually all people are
attracted to me. But they do not know that they are attracted to me. And when
they are attracted to my sparks, then they do not come to me by attraction to my
sparks. If a man is attracted to the beauty of a woman, then that attraction,
that beauty of a woman is not just her beauty. It may be temporary under her
position. But that is ultimately the arrangement of Krishna. If a pe...,
sports fan is attracted to a brilliant batsman, that talent is of that player
temporarily. When that person grows old, when that person becomes sickly, that
person cannot play the same way. 20:25
