Hare Krishna.

Welcome back to the Isopanisad course. Now, we come to the last section of
the Isopanisad, wherein there are prayers. Until now, it has been more of a
description based on a mystical vision, or a deep insight. Now that the
description is reaching its conclusion. Now, there is an appeal to the Supreme
Reality. Towards him the whole discussion was pushing that please help me. So,
let us look at the overview of the Isopanisad to understand how this section
comes up.

So, first was, section invocation, the three is. Live in harmony with Ishvara.
Then, if you want to live in harmony with the Ishvara, we have to know the
Ishvara. So, for that, we have to acquire spiritual vision. That was the next
section. And how do we acquire spiritual vision? By right vidya and right
upasana. So, what is the right vidya, the balance between vidya and avidya? The
balance between worship, of sambhuti and living through the vinasya, the
temporary. That was discussed in those sections, nine to eleven and twelwe to
fourteen. Now, after one has got knowledge. After, one has done worship. Still,
after that also, there is another. That is the mercy. So, knowle..., when we
want to make spiritual advancement, at that time, we need knowledge. I am not
the body. I am the soul. There is Supreme Being. And then we have to offer our
heart to God. So, we have to intellectually understand God. Then, we have to
offer our heart to God. And then, after that, God has to bestow His mercy on us.
And then, we make spiritual advancement. We ultimately return back to God. So,
in Damodar lila, there were two fingers that were short. One, it is said is
Yashoda Maya's endeavor. Second is Krishna's mercy. So, the endeavor involves
cultivating knowledge as well as doing worship. Now, cultivating knowledge is
not necessarily jnana-marga. It is also part of bhakti. And doing worship. So,
chanting Hare Krishna and trying to be attentive while chant is a part of our
endeavor. And seeking Krishna's mercy. And gaining Krishna's mercy, that comi..,
that descent of Krishna's mercy is His part. So, now, the Isopanisad is moving
foward to focusing on beseeching the mercy of the Absolute Truth. So, this is
the last section, prayers to Ishvara to reveal Himself. We want to live in
harmony with Him. That is not just based on fear that I will be punished. It is
based on attraction to the Ishvara. So for that, let the Ishvara reveal Himself.
And herein, we see the last past, last section's brief summary, overview.

So, there are four verse, mantras in it. So, fifteen, sixteen, are basically
talking about "Take me beyond the white light to the Supreme Brahman". So, this
is a request. This is an appeal to take beyond Brahman to Bhagavan. And then
seventeen, eighteen, he is saying even more personal prayer. Now, that we
perceived the Supreme Person. We know that that Supreme Person is supremely
merciful. Let me need the mercy. So, I have facing so many obstacles because of
my own past conditionings, because of the way my mind and senses are dragging me
here and there. And I need help. So, take me through all the obstacles of
conditioned life to you. That is the last section. So, actually, the last two
mantras in that purport are intensely devotional. And Srila Prabhupada's
analysis is very hope-giving as far as jna..., helping sadhakas to face the
battles that they have. And overcome the conditionings that are there inevitably
for all of us. So, let us start with the fifteenth mantra. Basically, this is a
prayer beseeching the Lord's grace so that we can behold his beautiful form.
This is often quoted verse, mantra by our acharyas.

        hiraṇmayena pātreṇa
        satyasyāpihitaṁ mukham
        tat tvaṁ pūṣann apāvṛṇu
        satya-dharmāya dṛṣṭaye

So, "hiraṇmayena pātreṇa", "hiraṇmayena" is golden effulgence. "pātre" is
covering. "satyasyāpihitaṁ mukham", of that Absolute Truth, "āpihitaṁ" is
covered. "mukham" is the face. So, the face of that Absolute Truth is covered by
dazzling effulgence. "tat tvaṁ pūṣann apāvṛṇu", "pūṣann", means you are the
maintainer oh Lord. Due, one who does "pūṣann". One who does maintenance is
"pūṣann". "apāvṛṇu", "apāvṛṇu" means please remove, please reveal. And
"satya-dharmāya dṛṣṭaye", by which your "satya-dharmā", "dharmā" is like nature.
So, "dharmā" of sugar is sweetness. "dharmā" of the living entity is serve the
Lord. There is very essential nature. So, unto the devotee, so, the one who is
living according to the "dharmā". Our "dharmā" is to love and serve. So, Srila
Prabhupada translates it at, unto the devotee. "satya-dharmāya dṛṣṭaye", for
revealing, for exhibiting. So, one who lives according to dharma, is referred to
here as "dharmāya". Now, what is the translation as Srila Prabhupada gives us?

"O my Lord, sustainer of all that lives,"

This is "pūṣann".

"Your real face is covered by Your dazzling effulgence."

        hiraṇmayena pātreṇa
        satyasyāpihitaṁ mukham

It is covered. So:

"Kindly remove that covering"

        tat tvaṁ pūṣann apāvṛṇu

"and exhibit Yourself to Your pure devotee."

        satya-dharmāya dṛṣṭaye

So, this is one of the most important verses in the Isopanisad for talking about
the personal aspect of the Absolute Truth being a higher reality than the
impersonal. So, thi..., there is a dazzling effulgence. There is no doubt about
it. And that is acknowledged even by the Vaishnava acharyas. But the Vaishnava
acharyas say that that dazzling effulgence, which is all-pervading, that is not
the ultimate reality. There is a reality beyond that. And that reality is the
reality of the Supreme Person, who has a "mukham", who has a face. It is that
face that is to be longed to be seen, and desires to see it over here. So, let
us look at the purport that Srila Prabhupada has given us and see the overview
of that purport. So, Srila Prabhupada's purport is remarkably insightful. And
first point is Pushann. Normally, we would consider the word Pushann, one who
does maintenance to refer to the Lord who provides heat, light, air, water, and
that is correct. But Srila Prabhupada takes the discussion much deeper. And he
says that Krishna is the basis of Brahman and Paramatma. Krishna is as Bhagavan.

And then, "satya-dharmāya dṛṣṭaye", that how Krishna reveals himself beyond the
Brahman. So, the idea of the verse is that there is a reality beyond Brahman.
Beyond the light, there is a higher reality which needs to be seen. And that
reality is Krishna Himself. Krishna reveals Himself beyond the Brahman. And
then, this paragraph six to teen are talking about how the ultimate revelation
of Bhagavan comes only by bhakti. So, although there are many aspects of the
Absolute Truth. Brahman, Paramatma, Bha..., but if you want, and they can be
accessed by various yogic methods. If one wants to access Bhagavan aspect, then
one has to apply the process of bhakti. Let us look at all these points one by
one now.

So, Srila Prabhupada gives a very profound analysis in this purport. And what he
essentially describes is how Bhagavan is the ultimate revelation of everything.
The ultimate revelation means that Bhagavan contains whatever is there in other
pot..., other aspects of the Absolute Truth, but there is something higher that
is also there in Bhagavan. So, let us look at this. Now, how Bhagavan is the
ultimate revelation. In Sankhya, you know there are various processes. Sankhya,
Jnana, Yoga and Bhakti. Now, Sankhya and Yo..., Jnana can be slightly related.
But there is some difference. What is Sankhya? Sankhya, Sankhya comes from the
word "sankhya". "sankhya" means to count. So, on, on one side of the table, we
see the process. On another side, we see the level of God realisation that can
be achieved through that process if that process is followed alone without
integrating it in, with, into bhakti. So, "sankhya", in, "san" refers to
counting.  That is what it is in Hindi and some of the vernacular languages
also. So, in "sankhya" basically, the spiritu..., the spiritual seeker starts
analysing the material world around, and starts thinking, what is this material
world ultimately made of? Is there any reality? I see beautiful forms. I see
beautiful taste, beautiful fragran..., delicious taste, captivating fragrances.
So, what is the reality beyond all this? Is there some unifying reality? Now, at
this stage, the seeker is not necessarily looking for a spirituality reality. He
is just looking for a reality beyond the appearances. So, in this case, the
seeker moves towards the fundamental elements. So, for example, when we see a
very attractive looking puri. Its figure, I can eat it now. It is so delicious.
It is nicely puffed up. And it is rounded shape. And it just looks eager to eat.
Now, if we look backwards. What would happen is that puri is made of some atha.
And it is made of some oil. Now, if somebody puts a, put that atha in front of
us. Our mouth will not water. Somebody put that oil in front of us. Our mouth
will not water. But if that atha, and if that flour, flour, and that oil is put,
is blended together, is cooked together nicely and is made into puri or a pakora.
Pakora will also mouth..., things, sabjis and other things. But whatever, when a
combination is made, it becomes so attractive. But whereas, if you go to the
original elements, 11:32
