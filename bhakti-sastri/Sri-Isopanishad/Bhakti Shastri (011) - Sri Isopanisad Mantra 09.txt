Hare Krishna.

So, today, we start with the third section of the Isopanisad. We have completed
from the introduction to mantra eight. So, the invocation to three, we were
talking about live in harmony with the Ishvara. Then mantras four to eight
talked about the Ishvara can be understood by spiritual vision. Now, how do we
develop that spiritual vision? That is through cultivating vidya and doing the
right upasana. So nine to eleven will talk about vidya and twelwe, thirteen,
fourteen will talk about upasana. Now, these verses, nine, ten, eleven, if we
look at them literally, their meanings seems to be quite confusing. The nine, we
will look at them in detail, but here a quick overc..., overview. The ninth
verse basically says that:

        andhaṁ tamaḥ praviśanti
        ye 'vidyām upāsate
        tato bhūya iva te tamo
        ya u vidyāyām ratāḥ

That those who are in, those who are in ignorance, they will go into darkness.
And those who are in knowledge, they will go into greater darkness. And then,
after that, it says that those who are in knowledge, and those who are in
darkness, actually speaking, there are two different results of this. And the
wise understand this. That, then after that, then one result is obtained by
cultivation of vidya, and another by the cultivation of avidya. And then the
ne..., third verse says that actually, when one cultivates vidya and avidya both
together, then one will go beyond the cycle of birth and death, and attain
liberation. So, now, first, it is saying that both vidya and avidya are bad.
In fact, vidya is worse than avidya. Then, it seems to say that vidya and avidya
will give two opposite results. And then, it says that vidya and avidya both
have to be cultivated together to beco..., attain liberation. So, what is going
on over here? So, actually, here, in these three mantras, as well as similarly
in the next three mantras, twelwe to fourteen, the same words, vidya and avidya
are used. But their meanings are different in each of these mantras. So, we
will look at the meanings of these mantras through a table, and we will see how
the same word can have different meanings depending on a different contexts.

So, in the fir..., ninth mantra, wh..., what does avidya mean?

        andhaṁ tamaḥ praviśanti
        ye 'vidyām upāsate

So, there, avidya means the ignorance and the ignorant pursuit of sense
gratification. That is avidya. So, those who live for sense gratification. They
are going to enter into darkness. And then:

        tato bhūya iva te tamo
        ya u vidyāyām ratāḥ

So, here, "vidyāyām ratāḥ", this is not knowledge, real knowledge in terms of
vidya, but so called knowledge. It is the knowledge that promotes sense
gratification. So, so..., those people, who with knowledge engage in sense
gratification, they usually commit far greater sinful activities. And that is
how they go deeper into darkness. So, here, avidya is ignorant pursuit of sense
gratification. And vidya is pursuit of sense gratification with knowledge. So,
then, then tenth mantra says:

        anyad evāhur vidyayā-
        nyad āhur avidyayā
        iti śuśruma dhīrāṇāṁ
        ye nas tad vicacakṣire

So, it is saying that one result is obtained by the pursuit of a..., a...,
avidya, and another result is obtained by the pursuit of vidya. So, what does it
here avidya and vidya do not mean the same thing? Although, the terms are the
same. Here, it is basically referring to material life and spiritual life. So,
that:

        anyad evāhur vidyayā-

So, what was called avidya and vidya in the first mantra? Both of them are
clapped together as avidya over here. So, here, especially, it refers to the
vidya, but essentially, pursuit of sense gratification is avidya, whether one
is doing it with in ignorance or with knowledge. So, what this mantra means is
that by pursuing sense gratification one result is obtained that is classified
as worshiping avidya. And another result is obtained by pursuing spiritual life,
ultimately Krishna Consciousness. So, here, vidya refers to the pursuit of
spiritual knowledge, the pursuit of spiritual goals. Avidya refers to material
knowledge and the pursuit of material pleasures. And then in the last mantra, it
says that:

        vidyāṁ cāvidyāṁ ca yas
        tad vedobhayaṁ saha
        avidyayā mṛtyuṁ tīrtvā
        vidyayāmṛtam aśnute

So, it says that with vidya and avidya, one can attain fearlessness and go
beyond the cycle of birth and death. "avidyayā mṛtyuṁ tīrtvā", by avidya, one
will go beyond "mṛtyuṁ", and "vidyayāmṛtam aśnute", by avidya, one will attain
amra-tattva, "āmṛta", eternality. So, what does this here refer to? Here, avi..,
the same words again with avidya and vi..., vidya, vidya are used, but here,
avidya refers to the knowledge for bodily maintenance. That means here, avidya
refers to the basic knowledge by which, how we have to keep ourselves healthy,
how we have to e..., earn a livelihood, how we have to maintain basic family
stability, and social harmony at a basic level. We cannot become happy in this
world, but we have to live harmoniously in this world without too much
disruptions. The knowledge for bodily maintenance here is called as avidya. So,
that avidya is required if one is to practice spiritual life. And then, so,
"avidyayā mṛtyuṁ tīrtvā", one will be able to navigate through this ocean of
material existence, if one has some knowledge of the ocean. You know, how the
waves can become too much. How the waves are,  become too less. But ultimately,
one has to go to the destination of eternity. That is the only way out of the
ocean. So, that destination, eternity will be attained by the practice of
spiritual life. Also, that is why vidya here refers to the knowledge of pursuit
of Krishna Consciousness.

So, to repeat here, so what is called as avidya and vidya in nine ver...? So,
that means basically common denominator is pursuing sense gratification in both
of them, in ninth mantra. And tenth mantra, both avidya and vidya from ninth
mantra is called as avidya. Because in both cases there is pursuit of sense
gratification. And, in the tenth and ma..., eleventh mantras, the meaning of
vidya remains the same. It is knowledge for the pursuit of Krishna
Consciousness. But the meaning of avidya changes from ten to eleven again. Ten
to eleven, it is, the change is that, eleven, it is not knowledge for pursuing
sense gratification. It is knowledge for bodily maintenance. So, we will look at
this table once again if it is little confusing right now. You, when we go over
the mantras, things will become more clear. But the main point I want to make
over here is that we cannot understand scripture just by knowing words. There is
text. And there is context. And unless we have a whole picture of the context,
just the text is not enough to comprehend things. By the texts, we will, we may
use a dictionary, and by the dictionary, we may get some basic understanding.
But we cannot get complete understanding just by dictionary alone. To get a
complete understanding, we need to have a, a broader understanding of the
context.

So, what vidya means, what avidya means, one has to carefully study and then
understand. So, the Upanishad especially, because they use words that are
multivalent. The words can have different meanings in different contexts. That
is why they are even more difficult to understand than the other books in the
Vedic library. So, the Upanishads are for the jnanis, and this is the kind of 
speculation that jnanis like to do. Why is this statement and this statement
contradictory over here? Why is this and this over here like this? And they are
trying to figure out, and come up with their own explanations. But actually, if
you want the real explanation, we have to come through guru saddhu sastra.
Because they are, the guru saddhu sastra parampara goes directly to Krishna.
And, it, it is not just historically going towards Krishna. It is also
internally going towards Krishna because the great acharyas are connected with
Krishna in their heart. And that is how:

        dadami buddhi-yogam tam
        
Krishna gives them the intelligence to understand things in a proper way. So,
now, let us move to the mantra:

        andhaṁ tamaḥ praviśanti
        ye 'vidyām upāsate
        tato bhūya iva te tamo
        ya u vidyāyām ratāḥ

So, "andhaṁ tamaḥ praviśanti", they will enter to the darkness of ignorance.
Who? "ye 'vidyām upāsate", those who worship avidya.

And "tato bhūya iva te tamo", that even "tato bhūya", again, even more, "iva
te", even greater "tamo", greater the "atmana" will be for those who "ya u
vidyāyām ratāḥ", so here "vidyāyām ratāḥ" means those who are absorbed in
knowledge. But actually, this knowledge is not spiritual knowledge. It is so
called knowledge. Those who are in so called knowledge, they will enter into
greater darkness. Let us look at this, translation. So, Prabhupada writes:

"Those who engage in the culture of nescient activities shall enter into the
darkest region of ignorance. Worse still are those engaged in the culture of
so-called knowledge."

The, so, let us look at the purport in terms of its flow. So, Srila Prabhupada
will explain first in the purport, why it is said that vidya is actually worse
than avidya. Normally, we would say vidya is better than avidya. So, we will
explain that in the first paragraph, then, second paragraph to four paragraph
will explain what exactly is avidyam upasate. How can one worship avidya. What
exactly does that mean. Then, he will talk about vidyayam ratah, so those who
are in so called knowledge, what is the so called knowledge? So, halfway through
the fourth paragraph, he starts that. And then he divides this into three
categories. The so called vi..., vidya can be Godless modern education. Then,
there is Veda-vada-ratah, there are those who study the Vedas, but they think
the Vedas are meant only to give us material knowledge, and they focus on that
material knowledge coming from the Vedas without looking at its, the spiritual
side. And mayayapahrita jnanah are those people who have knowledge, but maya has
stolen away their knowledge. These are the mayavadis. Those who claim to be God.
So, it is, this Srila Prabhupada will elaborate later also about Mayavadis, but
these are the three kinds of ca..., broad categories of people who have
knowledge, but they attain actually a destination, their knowledge does not give
them an auspicious destination. So, they are the Godless materialists. They are
the irreligious materialists, the gross materialists. Then they are the
religious materialists. And then they are the monists. Monists are those who say
everything is one. These are the mayavadis. So, let us look at these sections
now. So, why vidya is worse than avidya? So, Srila Prabhupada writes:

"Modern civilization has advanced considerably in the field of mass education"

So, where credit is due, we can due credit. Sometimes, we may say that Srila
Prabhupada has criticised scientists a lot. It is not that Srila Prabhupada was
criticising scientists. He says, yes, where scientists have done something good,
we can give credit over there. But the point is often they go beyond where
credit is due and make unwarranted, unscientific claims. He is saying, yes, as
compared to the past, we can say that, mass education is much more, more
civi..., as one, considerably in the field of mass education, but the result is
that people are more unhappy than ever before because of the stress placed on
material advancement to the exclusion of the most important part of life, the
spiritual aspect. People are more unhappy than ever before. Now, is this a claim
that can be substantiated? Maybe, we can say that happiness cannot be measured.
That is true. But still, we do see that as compared to the past, stress,
depression, addiction, suicide, all these are at proportions which were never
there in the past. You know, stress is such a m..., disastrous modern disease
which was not there in the past. So, now, in this century, there are, WHS
declared that mental diseases, mental health will be the greatest challenge.

So, diseases are serious problems. So, people are not happy. So, this is,
although, we may say we cannot quantify happiness. But if we look at the
statistics of overal well-being of people, as compared to even a few decades
ago, what to speak of centuries ago, you know, stress, depression, suicide,
addiction, these four having increased enormously. So, therefore, it is
undeniable that people are not happy. And they may be more comfortable, but they
are comfortably miserable. People have become comfortable physically. But
mentally, they are suffering. Now, in the past, people may be, may have been
sweating because of having to work under the Sun in the fields, but now, people
may have their plush AC offices, and inside the AC offices, they sweat, not
because of cold, but because of stress, because of tension. So, as far as
happiness is concerned, what Srila Prabhupada is saying is we just have to look
around. And there are many books which talk about statistically also how the
proportion of stress, suicide, addictions, depression, all these are far far
more than before. So then, what is the cause of this? Prabhupada explaining,
that he result is:

"people are more unhappy than ever before because of the stress placed on
material advancement to the exclusion of the most important part of life, the
spiritual aspect."

So, it is not that, we are specifically against material progress, What we are
against is the exclusion of the material aspect of life. When the material side
is neglected and only spiritual side is focused, sorry, material side is
highlighted excessively, and the spiritual side is neglected, then that leads to
serious imbalance. And people have lots of things. But they do not have
happiness. Martin Luther king said that we have guided missiles, but misguided
men. Our technological power has outrun our spiritual power. The means have far
run ahead, have exceeded the ends, for which they are meant to be. So, we have
uncontrolled machines, and we have, we have controlled machines, and
uncontrolled minds. It is the disastrous tragedy of our modern society.

Now, after this, Srila Prabhupada explains "'vidyām upāsate". What exactly is
"'vidyām upāsate"? So, forgetfullness of ishavasya principle, the principle that
the Absolute Truth, that the Supreme Lord is the owner of everything, is
the controller of everything. The forgetfulness of ishavasya principle is
avidya. So, will we, what is the practical implication of ishavasya principle?
That, if God is the controller, if God is the controller, then that means God is
the owner. God is the controller. That means things are not meant for my
enjoyment.

        tena tyaktena bhunjitha
        ma grdhah kasya svid dhanam 

Take only what is meant for you, not anything beyond that. But when I forget
that God is the controller, then the idea becomes, becomes that, ok, whatever I
can grab and get my hands on, I can enjoy. So, the immediate result of rejection
of God is enjoyment, enjoy mentality. In the Bhagavad Gita also, in the
sixteenth chapter, when Krishna talks about this:

        asatyam apratistham te
        jagad ahur anisvaram
        aparaspara-sambhutam
        kim anyat kama-haitukam

So, He says, in 16.8, in the Bhagavad Gita that those who say "anisvaram", they
say no "isvaram", they immediately come to the conclusion "kim anyat
kama-haitukam", what other purpose of this world is there beyond "kama", beyond
sensual enjoyment? That is the purpose of life. That is the, that h..., that,
that is how the degeneration of thoughts happens. We reject God, and then gross
sense gratification becomes the result. So, Srila Prabhupada writes that how can
one worship avidya? We do not have to make a deity of avidya, and start doing
aarti, and chapanho for avidya. So, avidya means forgetfullness of God. And
worship of avidya means, when we forget God, we pursue sense gratification.
Pursue sense gratification, not only we pursue sense gratification, but we make
sense gratification itself as the ultimate reality of life. You know, there are
some people. So, this, Prabhupada writes it, profitless pursuit of sense
gratification? Why profitless pursuit? Because, actually, in sense
gratification, the happiness is so little as compared to the effort, when we
c..., when we crave for sense pleasure, sometimes hours, and hours, and hours,
people are dreaming, I will do this. I will do this. I will enjoy. But the
actual pleasure, the body's capacity is for a few minutes. After that, it is
over. So, it is profitless pursuit of sense gratification. But this pursuit of
sense gratification has itself become like a religious activity for people.
You know, today, the kind of adulation that is offered to movie stars and other
such pop icons, is actually moldering on religious worship if not exceeding it
at the times. When these people co..., when some movie star comes along,
thousands of people are there, cheering that person, and that person is able to,
when George Harrison was at a speak, you know, what happened was that, he was in
a hotel staying, and then there was a, in the washroom of that hotel, there was
a towel, and he used that towel. And then the owner of that hotel took that
towel and sold it in auction and they made sixteen parts of it, and people
purchased each part of it at a huge price.

So, just as people take a deity, and the paraphernalia of the deity, a small
plot of the deity is considered sacred, so here, people are considering the
cloth that has been used once in a washroom by a, s..., by a music icon as
almost sacred. So, people go to place, whereas, film star was born and they
consider it to be sacred pilgrimage. And so, in this way, basically people make
sense gratification into a secular God. And they start worshiping those who
provide them sense gratification. But actually, they are temporary Gods. Because
as long as a person is providing sense gratification, that person is the object
of adulation. But as soon as the person becomes old, becomes disfigured, is no
longer able to provide sense gratification, person is tossed aside, and some
other person is brought over there. And when that person is put on the pedestal,
temporarily worshiped, and when that person no longer provides sense
gratification, tuck, that person is tossed off the pedestal and somebody else is
placed on the pedestal.

So, so, this is actually worship of avidya. So, worship of a..., avidya means,
the h..., zealous, almost fanatical and irrational pursuit of sense
gratification. That is what is seen in today's society. So, just a..., there are
some people who say why do you worship images of Gods? You know, do not worship
images of Gods. Well, you do not worship images of Gods, but then they put
images of movie stars, and f..., sport stars all around. And people look at them
as if they are taking some sacred darshan. So, essentially, worship of avidya is
this what is happening in society today. So, actually, whatever worship was
meant to be directed towards God, now, it is directed towards some other people.
So, this is how sense gratification is pursued by people, and this is called by
the Isopanisad as avidya upasate. Because we, we, we have nothing against f...,
movie stars or sport stars per say. But 21:35
