Hare Krishna.

Welcome back to the Isopanisad study.

Today, we will discuss the fifth verse of the Isopanisad. The fourth mantra was what we discussed yesterday, which is talking about how the Absolute Truth is inconceivable. So we will continue the discussion. This is a part of the second subsection of the Isopanisad. Section, four to eight which is understand Ishvara by spiritual vision. So in that, four to five talking about Ishvara is inconceivable to our normal intelligence.

Let us look at the mantra:

        tad ejati tan naijati
        tad dūre tad v antike
        tad antar asya sarvasya
        tad u sarvasyāsya bāhyataḥ

So, "tad ejati", that Absolute Truth, "ejati" means works, "tan naijati" means it does not work, so "tad dūre tad v antike", that Absolute Truth is far way, and he is close also, "tad antar asya sarvasya", He is inside of everything, and the same time, "tad u sarvasyāsya bāhyataḥ", He is outside of everything.

So here, three contradictory attributes of the Absolute Truth are talked about. He works, He does not work, He is far away, He is close, He is inside everything, He is outside everything. Now, at first glance, this appears absurd and contradictory.

And Srila Prabhupada's translation makes that contradiction even more appearant. The Supreme Lord works and does not work. He is far away, but he is very near as well. He is within everything, and yet he is outside of everything. So let us try to understand how this works out.

So, let us go over the purport of Srila Prabhupada that we can divide this purport into five main parts. The first point that Srila Prabhupada makes is the Supreme must be inconceivable.

Then, the second point is inconceivable does not mean that we cannot understand at all, we can gain some understanding, so that understand is how the Absolute Truth isfar yet near. "tad dūre tad v antike". That is what Srila Prabhupada explains.

Then, in connection with how that Lord is close by, "antike", Prabhupada introduces the concept of deity, and he talks about the Lord manifesting as deity. The science of deity worship is paragraph three to six.

And then Srila Prabhupada addresses the normal standard mayavadi notion that the Absolute Truth has no qualities and he looks at what the word Nirvana actually means.The Absolute Truth, how is Nirvana yet saguna?

And then, the last line, Srila Prabhupada raises, the point raised in, the mantra has third and fourth lines. So normally, when we refer to a mantra, so in scholar circles, so this "tad ejati tan naijati", this will be five a, "tad dūre tad v antike", this will be five b, "tad antar asya sarvasya", this is five, c, and "tad u sarvasyāsya bāhyataḥ", this is five d. So, in the last section of the purport how the Lord pervades everything, yet He is separate, that section, Srila Prabhupada addresses what is given in five c and d, how He pervades everything, yet transcends everything.

Now let us look at each of these points.

The Supreme must be conceivable. So Jiva Goswami in his Sandarbas addresses this point that logic cannot understand the Absolute Truth, but when logic cannot understand the Absolute Truth, the Absolute Truth is not illogical, but translogical.

So what is the difference illogical and translogical? If we consider this to be the logical level, illogical means that which is below the logical level. All that which is below logic is illogical. Whereas all that is above logic that is translogical. What does it mean below logical logic and above logic?

Below logic means that something does not make. Something is so insensible, something is so silly that it cannot stand the scrutiny of logic and it falls apart. Some person comes along and claims, I am God. Somebody told Srila Prabhupada I am God, Prabhupada said and I am the queen of England. So, it is such a stupid claim, anybody, ordinary person claims that I am God, so it is illogical.

Illogical means that which cannot stand the scrutiny of logic, whereas translogic means that in whose presence logic cannot stand. So, God, the Absolute Truth is so great, Absolute Truth is Supreme. And supreme means superior to our logical faculty. If we say logic, we should be able to understand and comprehend God completely, then God is no longer supreme, logic becomes supreme.

So, as written here, do not make logic into a secular God. Secular God means that people say do not believe in God, or they do not care for God, do not value God and they say, logic is greater than God. Do not make logic into secular God. Let logic be our minister, not master.

That means that there we understand that logic is valuable. Logic is very useful in many cases, but logic is the Absolute Authority. Logic is subordinate to God ultimately. So let logic be our minister, not master. That means wherever, it is, wherever is the jurisdiction of logic, there we use logic to examine and understand, what is what. But beyond that, we understand that there are many places where logic does not apply.

So how it does not apply? For example, when we talk about torch light. A torch light can help us to see the way when it is dark, and the torch light is very valuable. But if I decide to point the torch light at the sky at night, and say, I want to see where the Sun is, I cannot find the Sun with the torch light. The torch light has its utilitiy, but then there are areas where also the torch light will lead us to futility.

The torch light will not be useful for us to find the Sun in the sky. The Sun is far greater. So to find the Sun, we cannot use the torch light. When the sun rises on its own, at that time, we will see the Sun, its self-effulgent glory, without the torch light at all.

So, the first point here is that when we come to God, God is like the Sun, logic is like the torch light. So, we do not deny the role of logic. When there is darkness, at that time, logic is valueable, no doubt. When there is complete confusion, anybody is claiming anything, then to consider what is right and wrong, we have to use logic, and the Vedic scriptures also do use logic.

So in fact the whole Bhagavad Gita, the Vedanta Sutra is all based on logic in many cases, but at the same time, when it comes to the direct study of the Absolute Truth, we understand the Absolute Truth is the greatest being. He is great than logic also.

So the Lord is not illogical, but translogical. So logic, that does not substitute for experience. I will explain this point. Suppose I have to go to a doctor to find out what is my disease and what is the treatment I should take. That naturally, I have to use my logical intelligence to evaluate what the doctor is saying.

If I have a stomach upset and the doctor says, we have to amputate your leg, says, what is this? Does not make sense. So we will use our logic naturally.

Now, if after using my logic, what the doctor says makes sense, then the doctor describes the healthy condition to me and tells, this is the medicine that you take, then you will become healthy. Now, is it possible that just by using my logical intelligence to understand how the medicine works, I will get cured?

No, logic cannot substitute for experience. Logic helps us to understand which experience I should undergo, and whether that experience is producing its desired result. That means when I should go to a doctor to take treatment or not. What the doctor says makes sense or not, and after that, when the doctor is saying, it will cure me, is it curin me actually? So I can use my intelligence to evaluate that.

But beyond that, logic cannot substitute for experience. Similarly, logic can help us to differentiate between real spirituality, authentic spirituality, and shadow or pseudo spirituality. So logic does have its utility, but beyond that, logic cannot cure us. For that, we have to practice spiritual life, we have to practice devotional life. And we practice devotional life, that gives us the Supreme result of divine perception, of perception of the higher reality of life.

So to continue with the doctor example, instead of just talking about good health, if I talk of a person who is blind, and there is a medical process by which the person can be cured. Now, the doctor may describe, you know, this is how, this is the disease in your eye, because of you are not able to see. This is the medicine you will take. And by that, you will get cured and you will be able to see.

Now, the process of medication will lead to the recovery of the eyes of the person. And when the eyes recover, at that time, the person will be able to see. But this does not mean that just logically understanding how the process works, we will be able to grant the perception, the vision to the person. No, the person has to undergo the treatment, then vision will be possible.

So similarly in this case, we have to actually develop a higher understanding, a higher vision by which we will be able to see the supreme reality. The superior reality of life is spiritual reality, and we currently do not have spiritual vision. So rather than rejecting the spiritual as illogical, we have to accept the spiritual as translogical, and raise ourselves upwards.

So now, there is a kind of logic, even in transcendence and let us try to understand that.

So now, for example, "tad dūre tad v antike", this is what the Isopanisad says, that the Absolute Truth is far away, and He is close also. So now, is this a contraction? Actually, it is not a contradiction, it is a paradox. What is the difference between the two?

Contradiction is opposite statements that do not make sense. For example, you say excess fat, and then you say excess thin. Now, both do not make sense at the same time. They are contradictions. Excess is either fat or thin.

So paradox, on the other hand, is opposite seeming statements that make sense at a deeper level. Opposite seeming statements, they are not contradictions. They are opposite statements and they are meant to grant us understanding at a deeper level.

For example, when we say, the least corrected people are the most correct. So, we discussed this example earlier of the least corrested people, something that is the least corrected. So the teacher is checking the people, and the people are the least corrected, with minimum red marks.

Now what happens is the least corrected people are most correct. What does it mean? It means that actually the least corrected, most correct, does not make sense, but there is a higher meaning. The teacher had to correct those people the least, because what the student have written is the most correct. So the least corrected people are the most correct, there jucst (?, 13:29) opposition, jucst opposition means bringing close to each other, of contradictory seeming words, opposite seeming words together, least corrected, most corrected. Jucst opposition forces us to think. And then oh, this is what it means.

So, similarly, in the scriptures give us contradictory seeming statements. There is a deeper meaning that is there. And that deeper meaning has to be understood by proper contemplation. Without that contemplation, we just stay at the superficial level, and we will reject us, oh, this does not make any sense. It makes sense, but we have to go deeper.

So, "tad dūre tad v antike", so is this possible? We understand this at many levels. We know that the Absolute Truth has three manifestations, as Brahman, there is Paramatma, and there is Bhagavan. So, the Paramatma aspect is right next to us in our own heart. So being present in the heart, the Paramatma is closer and the closest. Even if some person embraces us tightly, still that person cannot come as close to us as the Paramatma does, as the Paramatma is always.

        sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto
        ...

In 15.15 in the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna says, "sarvasya caham hrdi", the hearts of everyone ready, "sannivisto", I sit very close, closer and the closest. So in that sense, "tad v antike", but at the same time, Krishna is Bhagavan, He is in the spiritual, performing pastimes, and "tadure", so far away. Brahma Samhita says:

        panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampragamyo
        vāyor athāpi manaso muni-puńgavānām
        so 'py asti yat-prapada-sīmny avicintya-tattve
        govindam ādi-puruṣaḿ tam ahaḿ bhajāmi

        So, the Isopanisad says that, sorry, sorry, the Brahma samhita says that, that even the great sages, that by the path, "panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara", hundreds of crawls of years, if they, "sampragamyo", they keep traveling, and how fast? "vāyor athāpi manaso", they go even at the speed of the wind, or even at the speed of mind, still, "prapada-sīmny avicintya-tattve", "prapada", even in the feet, "pada" is feet, "prapada" is front part of the feet, that means the toes. They will not be able to touch even the toes of the Supreme Lord. "avicintya-tattve", he is "avicintya", he cannot be understood. To that Govinda, I offer my obeisances. Brahmaji is praying in Brahma samhita.

So He is so far away that we cannot reach Him. So as Bhagavan, He is far away, as Paramatma, He is close to us. So similarly, "tad ejati tan naijati", what was the first line of this verse? That person walks, and that person does not walk. What does it refer to? Actually, the Supreme Lord as Brahman is all pervading. The Supreme Lord as Brahman, He, because He is everywhere, He does not have to walk anywhere.

As Brahman, as the all pervading light:

        apani-pado javano grahita
        pasyaty acakshuh sa srinoty akarnah
        ...

So the Svetasvatara Upanishad describes that that Lord "apani-pado", he has no hands, and no legs. At the same time, "javano grahita", although he has no hands and no legs, when somebody offers Him food, immediately, from wherever He is, He comes there and He accepts. So if He does not have legs, how does He come? If He does not have hands, how does He accept?

So the "pasyaty acakshuh sa srinoty akarnah", so that person, "acakshuh", He has no eyes, but He sees, "pasyaty". "akarnah", He has no ears, "sa srinoty", He hears. How does it all that happen? Because, although He does not have material eyes, He has transcendental eyes. Although He does not have material ears, He has transcendental ears.

So here that is being made is deep, that what is a contradiction, what seems to be a contradiction at a material level, at the immediate level of perception conveys a deeper reality.

So Srila Prabhupada brings out this point in his purport by the talking about "tad dūre tad v antike", he brings to the point of deity worship. So now, what exactly is the concept of deity worship? To say that God cannot appear as matter is to limit him. This is a very important point to understand. You know, many impersonalists, and many iconoclasts, iconoclast means, icon means symbol, iconoclast means those who destroy symbols. So iconoclast refers to those religionists who do not accept deity worship, and they often delight in destroying deities because they say all symbols are false, and the symbols need to be destroyed so that we can go to the real God, we can focus on the real God.

So, they say that God is infinite, God is unlimited. How can you limit Him that God to us, stone form like this? So, for such people, what is described is, that when they say that God cannot come as a form, are we not limiting God by that?

So, you, one can argue that, as, if we say that God has, you know, a particular form, like we here, we have Lord Caitanya, so they say God cannot appear in a form, say, God cannot appear in a form. God cannot appear in limited form as a deity. But isn't that limiting God? So what we can say that, God is, we are not limiting God. So by saying that, God cannot appear in a form, we are limiting Him. 

So actually speaking, the Vedic scriptures, especially the Pancaratva scriptures describe that God can appear in form, he is so unlimited appear that he can appear in a limited seeming form and still stay unlimited. God is so unlimited that he can appear in a limited seeming form and still stay unlimited. How is this possible?

There is a great Sri Vaishnava acharya, Pilayloka acharya. He was another prominent successor of Ramanuja acharya. Here I am talking about one successor, that is one line of successor. Vedanta Desika was a prominent acharya. The other is Pilayloka acharya.

So Pilayloka acharya gives this example of the elephant. See, there is a small child, and the child sees a majestic elephant walking on the street. And then the child thinks, oh I want to touch the head of the elephant. The child is so small, no matter how much the child stretches up, for the child cannot reach the elephant. Stop.

How will the child reach? Even if the child grows up still, the child will never reach the top of the elephant. For the child, it is not possible.

But if the elephant sits down. Elephant sits down and lays down, and then brings the head close to the child, the child can touch the head very happily.

So similarly, all of us souls, "mamevam so jivaloke", we are small "amisas" of the Lord. We are like that child. And we cannot access the Supreme Lord. The Lord is at the spiritual level of reality. So how can we acess Him? We have material eyes, material senses, we cannot. But when the Lord descends, then the Lord becomes accessible to us. So that is the great mercy of the Lord that He descends from the spiritual realm to the material realm, and manifests as the deity. This is the elephant sits down.

Now, when the elephant sits down, the elephant still has its height, it still has its power, but it has chosen to sit down. Similarly, as I said, the unlimited is so unlimited that it can manifest, that He can manifest in a limited form, and still stay unlimted. The elephant can sit down, and still have the power which it has when he is at full height.

So when Krishna manifests as the deity, He is not limited. He is
