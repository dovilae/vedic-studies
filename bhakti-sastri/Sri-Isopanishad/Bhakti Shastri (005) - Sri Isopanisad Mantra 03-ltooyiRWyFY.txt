Hare Krishna.

So welcome back to our Isopanisad course.

So let us start with the overview of the first section once again, to understand where we are. The invocation and the introduction, or the mantra one, give the principle. What is that? Everything is perfect. And that perfection is based on the fact that everything belongs to the Ishvara.

So in the verse yesterday, we discussed about how ... living in harmony with Ishvara and the isavasya principle, benefits people. People can live life long, for hundreds of years. Now in this verse, the contrasting point is made. That how living in disharmony with the isavasya principle harms us.

So let us look at this verse, so before we go into that verse, let us first look at the purport, which Srila Prabhupada has given us. So this verse is:

        asuryā nāma te lokā
        andhena tamasāvṛtāḥ
        tāṁs te pretyābhigacchanti
        ye ke cātma-hano janāḥ

So, asurya nama te loka, that those worlds are called the abodes of the demoniac. Why? asurya nama te loka, those worlds are called as the world of the demoniac, adnhena tamasavrtah, those are covered by ignorance of, by darkness and ignorance, by the darkness of ignorance, avrtah is covered, andhena is darkness, and what kind of darkness, tamasa, of ignorance, and tams te pretya, tams te means those words, pretya means after that, so abhigacchanti, one will attain that. Who will attain that? ye ke catma-hano janah, so those janah, those people who are atma-hano, who are the killers of the soul, and ye ke indicates that whoever they may be, they will go to these dark abodes.

So basically, this verse is a warning, it is a warning that if one lives in a soul-killing way, if one lives without awareness of one's spiritual nature, without taking care of one's spiritual responsibilities, then one will, because one lives ignorantly now, one will go into further deeper ignorance in the future. So in this way, this is like a parent telling the child, if you do not study, you will fail, and if you fail, then you will have no career ahead of you. You will live in poverty. You will live in ignominy, nobody will respect you, nobody will employ you. You will be miserable. So it is a warning that is given.

So similarly, here it is said that if a person does not accept one's spiritual responsibilities, then one will have to suffer. That suffer is, one will go deeper into ignorance. So let us look at what the purport is saying. So the purport basically has three sections, six paragraphs.

So in the first paragraph, which is brief, Srila Prabhupada explains who is a demon. Here the word is, asurya nama te loka, so asura, Prabhupada explains, covered asura. Then who is a soul-skiller? The word atma-hano, the killer of the soul comes in the last line of the mantra. So what is that soul-killer? That Prabhupada describes, so he clarifies these two terms from the sanskrit verse and then he elaborates on the basic message. The basic message of the purport is, liberate the soul, do not kill the soul.

And the first paragraph talks about how we human beings misuse, so we will discuss the paragraphs in details, but first, let us look at who is a demon. Now Srila Prabhupada said: the killer of the soul, whoever he may be, must enter into the planets, known as the worlds of the faithless, full of darkness and ignorance.

So Srila Prabhupada first explains that asura is one who is demoniac. Now, the word asura has many meanings.

In general in sanskrit or in any language, there is a field of study, called as etymology. Etymology means we study the origins of the words and by understanding the origins of those words, we understand how their meaning is built up. So for example, there may be the English word, say, lexicographer. So graphy means who writes, lexico means dictionary, so lexicographer is a person who makes a dictionary.

So like that by looking at the etymology, we can understand the roots of the words, and then we can understand their meanings, so this is an elaborate field of study.And in some cases, the etymological meanings may not be historically precise, but they are semantically precise. Historically precise means, that may not be the exact way the words have evolved in the history, but from the meaning point of view, some meanings become well illustrated.

So asura, so what does asura mean? So "asu" refers to breath and "ra" means to enjoy, "ramante" to enjoy. So the word "asu" as breath comes in a famous verse in the Bhagavad Gita:

        ...
        gatasun agatasums ca
        nanusocanti panditah

So in 2.11 in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, one who is asu, one whose life air has gone, and one whose life air has not gone way, such a person, wise person does not lament for either of those situations, so "asu" means life air. So, "ra" means to enjoy. So "asura" means one who enjoys the life air. That means the life air is in the body, one who wants to enjoy the body. So, one who wants to enjoy at the bodily level, sense gratification, in a Godless, sanctuous materialistic way, that person is called as an asura.

So Srila Prabhupada explains that in the Rigveda, it is quoted: "Vishnu bhakta smritodevo, asurasta viparyaya". Those who are devotees of the Lord, are bhaktas, and others are the asuras, and "Sada Vishnu paramam padan sada pasyanti suryaha", the Supreme feet of Lord Vishnu, the suras are all seeing that, and the asuras are exactly opposite.

So now, an important point to understand is: asura is not a species, but is also a mentality. We generally think of a demon as maybe somebody having teeth coming out of the head, teeth coming out of the mouth, horns on top of the head, but that is not necessary. There can be demons like that and we see in the Ramayana when the battle is there, now on one side are the human beings along with the monkies, and other side, there are the rakshasas. And when the rakshasas have ferocious forms, Ravana had ten heads, Kumbarkarna was a gigantic body. Many of the rakshasas, especially those rakshasis who were guarding Sita, they were hideous forms. So there can be rakshasas who have terrible forms also, but if we look at the Mahabharata, the battle is not between manavas and rakshasas, it is between manavas and manavas, human beings and human beings.

And actually in the Mahabharata battle, there are rakshasas on both sides. Now, there is Gathodkachandra on the side of the Pandavas, he is the son of Bhimatrumahidimbi, hidimbi was a rakshasi, so Gathodkacandra was a rakshasa. And there is Alongbush, who is also a rakshasa, who was the relative of Bakasura, who was killed by Bhima. So he wanted to take revenge, so he joined Duryodhana's part. So there are rakshasas on both sides.

So the point here I am making is in the Mahabharata war, both sides were human beings. But still, Duryodhana and those who were assisting him actively, they are considered demoniac. So Duryodhana did not have the body of a demon, but he had the mentality of a demon. So asura is not just a physical form. Asura is a mentality. And that mentality can be persist by human beings also. In fact, in the sixteenth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, when Lord Krishna describes the "daiva asura sampada vibhaga yoga", so he says divine characteristics and demoniac characteristics. So there he is describing human society itself. When he is saying, they can have demoniac characteristics. So asura is not just a physical form.

So Jayadvaita Maharaja has written an article in Back to Godhead, called who is a demon? So he says, we think of a demon as a horned, jolt person with deep portion, but that is not necessary. He says that your local politician might be a demon, your grocer might be a demon, your neighbour might be a demon, you might be a demon. So, all of us have the demoniac mentality within us, and if we let ourselves become dominated by that demoniac mentality... we have a divine side and a demoniac side. If we let the demoniac side take control of us, then we behave demoniacly.

So here, when it is using the word "asurya nama te loka", so now, there are mentalities which are demoniac, and for the demoniac beings, there is also localities within the cosmography of the Universe. So we know that the Earth is intermediate, often the fourteen planetary systems are referred to as three lokas. The upper, the middle and the lower. So the middle planetary system is the earthly planetary system. The lower is that which is below. And the demons often go to these lower planetary systems.

So "asurya nama te loka", so for the demoniac people, there are also some localities within the Universe. And those are the places where people who live Godlessly will go. That is the meaning of this verse.

Now let us look at a very important point. That is the term atma-ha. Atma-ha is a, is means literally killer of the soul. Now, the first lesson of the Bhagavad Gita is that the soul cannot be killed. In 2.17 for example, Krishna says:

        avinasi tu tad viddhi
        yena sarvam idam tatam
        vinasam avyayasyasya
        na kascit kartum arhati

So in 2.17, Lord Krishna is setting, "avinasi tu tad viddhi", that the soul can never be killed. But that same Bhagavad Gita, towards the end in the sixteen chapter, Lord Krishna tells in 16.21:

        tri-vidham narakasyedam
        dvaram nasanam atmanah
        kamah krodhas tatha lobhas
        tasmad etat trayam tyajet

So Krishna says that there are three gates to hell, and these three destroy the soul, and a wise person should stay away from them, and those three are lust, anger and greed. Now interestingly, what is Krishna is saying? "dvaram nasanam atmanah", "nasanam atmanah" means they destroy the soul. So now, in 2.17, Krishna has said the soul can never be destroyed, and now, in 16.21, he is saying lust, anger and greed will destroy the soul. So is Krishna contradicting himself?

No. He is not contradicting himself. He is talking here in a non-literal sense. So there can be literal readings of words, and in some cases, there can be non-literal readings of words. So, we know that as a fact, the soul can never be destroyed. So, killer of the soul means killer of the spiritual consciousness of the soul. So what does lust do? We may be aware spiritually that I am not the body, I am the soul. Life is meant for spiritual realisation.

But then if I expose myself to certain pictures, certain circumstances that make me lusty, then that lust makes me forget that I am the soul and it arouses bodily consciousness within me. So with lust kills my spiritual awareness. So when we talk about the killing of the soul, it is not killing the existence of the soul, it is killing the spiritual consciousness of the soul.

So here, atma-ha is a figurative expression. Now, in the Caitanya Caritamrta, this is referred to as Mukhya-vritti and Gauna-vritti, or the Caitanya Caritamrta says abhida-vritti and lakshana-vritti. So there are multiple names. Vritti means mode of understanding. So Mukhya-vritti is the primary mode of understanding. Gauna is the subordinate mode of understanding. Abhida is again central, lakshana is secondary, symptomatic.

So these are both ways in which scripture can be understood. We can take the direct literal meaning or we can take the indirect non-literal meaning. So when do we take the direct meaning and when do we take the indirect meaning? So, we cannot just arbitrarily take a non-literal meaning. Srila Prabhupada was very strongly against taking the non-literal meaning of scripture when that is not based in scripture.

For example, many Indian nationalist thinkers who use the Bhagavad Gita as a tool in their political struggle for independency, were embarassed by the idea that the Bhagavad Gita was spoken to make Arjuna fight a war. So they try to say that this whole war was metaphoric. That actually it is just a battle within our consciousness.

So Srila Prabhupada says where does the Bhagavad Gita say that? It is, the historical event was there, and the historical context makes it very clear that the Bhagavad Gita was a battle, led to a battle that was actually fought. So, such interpretation, if it is not based on scripture, is wrong. But if the scriptures themselves support a little non-literal interpretation, or a figurative interpretation, then that can be accepted.

So now, in this case, in the Srimad Bhagavatam, in 11.20.17, there is another verse, which literally explains what the word atma-ha means. So this verse is actually a correlation for what is being said over here. That means when we talk about scripture, we cannot understand scripture in isolation. So this is the verse:

        nṛ-deham ādyaṁ su-labhaṁ su-durlabhaṁ
        plavaṁ su-kalpaṁ guru-karṇadhāram
        mayānukūlena nabhasvateritaṁ
        pumān bhavābdhiṁ na taret sa ātma-hā

(15:32)
