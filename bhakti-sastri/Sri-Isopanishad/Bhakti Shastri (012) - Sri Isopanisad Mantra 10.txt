Hare Krishna.

Welcome to the Isopanisad course. We will today discuss mantra ten. So, we are
discussing the third section of the Isopanisad. In this third section, the topic
is vidya. How vidya can lead us to the Absolute Truth. So, in the previous
verse, mantra, we discussed how those who are in ignorance, those who are in
avidya, those who worship avidya going to darkness. And those who continue
to worship avidya, but imagine that they are in vidya. Those who are having so
called knowledge, they are going into deeper ignorance. So, now, this verse will
say that in contrast to both these two people. These two people that means both
of them are basically in avidya, but they think tha..., one of them thinks that
we are in avi..., vidya. So, as contrasted to this avidya, is vidya. And this
ver..., mantra will say that by the cultivation of vidya and the cultivation of
avidya, different results come about. So, let us look at this mantra, mantra
ten:

        anyad evāhur vidyayā-
        nyad āhur avidyayā
        iti śuśruma dhīrāṇāṁ
        ye nas tad vicacakṣire

So, "anyad", "anyad", means, "nyad āhur", "evāhur", it is said, "āhur" is said,
"evā", certainly, "vidyayā-" that by "vidya", "anyad", one, some result comes.

"nyad āhur avidyayā", it is said that by "avidya" another results comes. One
results comes by "vidya", another by "avidya".

"iti śuśruma", thus we have heared "dhīrāṇāṁ", from the great souls.

"ye nas tad vicacakṣire", they have explained this to us. So, here, "vina", so,
so Jango Manu is speaking this to Jagna Avatar, as prayers of invocation. And he
is saying that, I have heard that by the cultivation of knowledge one result
comes about, and by the cultivation of ignorance, another result comes about.
So, let us see Prabhupada's translation.

        "The wise have explained"

That is "dhīrāṇāṁ", "vicacakṣire".

        "... that one result is derived from the culture of knowledge"

"anyad evāhur vidyayā-"

        "... and t at a different result is obtained from the culture of
        nescience."

"nyad āhur avidyayā"

So, basically, the scriptures use different methods, for, in, for conveying
their message. One of the most potent methods that the scriptures uses is
contrasting. Contrasting m..., means if you do this, this will happen. If you do
this, this will happen. Now, you decide what you want to do. So, Krishna uses
this repeatedly in the Bhagavad Gita also. And this makes things very crystal
clear.

        mac-cittah sarva-durgani
        mat-prasadat tarisyasi
        atha cet tvam ahankaran
        na srosyasi vinanksyasi

In 18.58, in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says that if you become conscious of me,
you will pass over all obstacles by my grace. If, however, you act out of false
ego, not hearing me. Then, you will be lost. "vinanksyasi". This is constrast
Krishna is doing. So, instructing by const..., contrasting is a very clear and
empathetic way of intrus..., instructing. So, this is what the Isopanisad is
also doing over here. It is contrasting vidya and avidya. Now, in this k..., in
this mantra, avidya refers to, in general, the knowledge o..., the pursuit of
sense gratification. And even knowledge that helps in the pursuit of sense
gratification is called as avidya. And vidya refers to knowledge that helps us
to develop in spiritual understanding, ultimately in Krishna Consciousness. So,
let us look at Srila Prabhupada's purport. Vidya leads to desirable qualities.
So, that is the first two paragraphs. In fact, here, Srila Prabhupada lists the
twenty characteristics of knowledge that are given in the Bhagavad Gita,
13.8-12, and then in con..., Srila Prabhupada,  after describing this, contrasts
this with the result of the cultivation of avidya, as is seen in today's
society. Avidya leads to undesirable qualities. And how those undesirable
qualities are seen in today's society? Prabhupada explains.

And then, finally, paragraphs six to nine, he explains only a dhira can teach
vidya. That means, we intellectually think, ok, I, I want vidya. I do not want
avi..., avidya. But actually, from a practical point of view, it is only a
person who is sober, who is not deluded by material things, can actually teach
knowledge, in a systematic way. That is why the word "dhīrāṇāṁ" comes over here.

So, let us go back to the first section. Now, Sri..., here, Srila Prabhupada
lists the eighteen chara..., twenty characteristics of, given in the Bhagavad
Gita, as a list of long eighteen statements. And actually, seeing these eighteen
statements is quite insightful. So, for example, the first qua..., quality over
here is:

        amanitvam adambhitvam
        ahimsa ksantir arjavam

These are the first five qualities, then, 13.8-12 in the Bhagavad Gita, 13.8.
Now, let us see how Srila Prabhupada translates "amanitvam". So, "amanitvam"
means humility or pridelessness. That is how it is there in the Bhagavad Gita.
And now, Srila Prabhupada translates it here as:

"(1) One should become a perfect gentleman and learn to give proper respect to
others."

That means how do I say, how do I know that somebody is humble? Somebody says,
oh, Prabhuji, I am so fallen. Oh, mataji, I am so fallen. I am good for nothing.
I am this. Is that really humility? It may not be. It may be a
self-centeredness masquerading as humility. So, actually, real humility is more
directly expressed by how we respect others. "amanina manadeva". So, "amani",
how much we res..., want respect for ourselves. That is very difficult for us to
e..., deal with, to get rid of, or even to curb. So, but, we can surely start
res..., offering respects to others. And that is a positive way in which we can
cultivate humility because when we are respecting others, we are giving them
thought, attention, and regard. And that essentially is humility. Actually,
pride means we are so filled ourselves that no one else matters. When we start
respecting others, that is a positive, more Krishna Conscious way to develop
humility. Because we think about others and give them thought, attention, time,
and that way we become less self-conscious. So, humility is not so much thinking
low about ourselves. It is more about thinking less about ourselves. You know, I
am not such an important person in the world that I have to think about myself
all the time. I will think about others. You know, think about others. Then that
naturally makes me less filled of myself. And that is how I become humble. So,
learn to give proper respect to others. Then "adambhitvam", Srila Prabhupada
translates as:

"(2) One should not pose himself as a religionist simply for name and fame."

So, "dambh" normally means, so "amanitvam" r..., refers to when I have good
qualities. But still, I do not demand respect. I do not expect respect. That is
"amanitvam". "dambh", now, "dambh", when I do not have qualities, and still, I
ask for respect. That is "dambh". That means I am, I do not know anything about
Bhagavad Gita. I just know one or two verses. And then I say, Bhagavad Gita is
just:

        karmanda vadikar aste ma phale suka dachana

Bhagavad Gita is just work is worship. So, I pretend to have knowledge. So that,
people will respect. No, such a scholarious. So, that is "dambh". And Prabhupada
says here "One should not pose himself as a religionist simply for name and
fame.". So, these are all cha..., characteristics of vidya. So, this is a
remarkable and consistent correlation we will see that Srila Prabhupada brings
about between Isopanisad and Gita Upanishad. So, Bhagavad Gita is also known as
Gita Upanishad. In fact, it is the essence of all the Bhagavad Gitas as the Gita
Mahatmya says.
        
	sarvo panishado gavo
	dogdha gopala nandanah
	partho vatsah sudhir bhokta
	dugdham gita amritam mahat 

So, all the Upanishads are like a cow, and just as the essence of the cow is
the milk, similarly, the essence of all the Upanishads is Bhagavad Gita, the
Gita Upanishad. And just as the milk comes out in the presence of a calf,
"partho" is the calf, and there is a milkman, milkman, a cowherd is required to
bring out the milk, that is Krishna. And when the milk comes, it is not only the
calf who takes it. Other people also take the milk. So, like that, "sudhir".
So, "dhīrāṇāṁ" is the word over here also in this verse. "sudhir" is those who
are sober. All those people will drink the nectar of the Gita. Now, this is Srila
Prabhupada correlating Isopanisad and Gita Upanishad. So, the Isopanisad talks
about Gi..., vidya, and Srila Prabhupada explains vidya based on Bhagavad Gita.
This is, now, this is called as jnana:

        etaj jnanam iti proktam
        ajnanam yad ato 'nyatha

13.8-12, the twelwe C and D says that this is knowledge, and apart from this,
whatever there may be, it is ignorance. Now, the, "ahimsa". Now, Srila
Prabhupada gives extraordinary translation of "ahimsa" over here. Normally, we
will say non-violence. But Srila Prabhupada gives a much and deeper translation.

"(3) One should not become a source of anxiety to others by the actions of his
body, by the thoughts of his mind, or by his words."

So, this means that one not only, should one not commit violence to, to create
agitation and anxiety to others, that is also way of committing violence. And
that also, one should not do. And one should not be anxiou..., cause anxiety to
others by our thoughts, words or actions. This is a very profound definition of
"ahimsa".

And then, like that, Srila Prabhupada g..., gives the list, So, "acaryopasanam".
That is worship of the spiritual master. That is the sixth item. Srila
Prabhupada translates that as:

"(6) One should search out a bona fide spiritual master who can lead him
gradually to the stage of spiritual realization, and one must submit himself to
such a spiritual master, render him service and ask relevant questions."

So, what is this? This is a translation of 4.34 in the Bhagavad Gita. 4.34 is:

        tad viddhi pranipatena
        pariprasnena sevaya
        upadeksyanti te jnanam
        jnaninas tattva-darsinah

So, how one should approach the spiritual master. Srila Prabhupada is giving
that also. So, actually, when Srila Prabhupada gives us his purports. He gives
us, like there are some cars. So, the cars, they say maximum mileage per hour,
or per litre. Maximum mileage. It will go this much miles. So, like that, Srila
Prabhupada gives us maximum mileage per purport. You know, whatever purport he
gives us, he gives us maximum knowledge in it. Just, prof..., Prabhupada's
translation is not just a cursory function, which he has to do. This is
Engli..., This is Sanskrit. This is English. Let me translate and put it.
Prabhupada wants to convey the profound wisdom that is there in the Vedic
literature. And knowing that, it is, that, in wisdom has to be conveyed in a way
that people can apply and benefit. Therefore, it is there, it is, the, the
Bhagavad Gita says that "acaryopasanam". Now, Krishna was speaking at a time
when people knew how to do "acaryopasanam". Now, people today do not know.
Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says that, ok, you have to go to the spiritual
master and search out. Our spiritual master, what kind of spiritual master? Not
simply an ashravat guru. Not simply a person who will smile and just raise the
hands and blessing. No. A person who will lead one gradually to the stage of
spiritual realisation. So, Prabhupada is, that, well, "acaryopasanam", what kind
of acharya should we do "upasanam" of it else that? And how "acaryopasanam" has
to be done, it is not just that we take aarti plate and do "upasanam".
"upasanam" is done by submission, service and inquiry, "SSI". So, that is what
Sri... Submit. Service. And Inquiry.

So, this is how Srila Prabhupada gives us maximum mileage 12:45
