Hare Krishna.

Welcome back to the Isopanisad course.

Today, we will do the tenth, eleventh verse now. So, yesterday, we completed
tenth. Let us have a quick overview of nine, ten, eleven, to see what is
happening. So, I have put a paraphrase trans..., simplified translation of these
verses over here. Avidya takes to darkness, and vidya to greater darkness. That
is ninth. Then tenth is vidya gives one result. And avidya gives another result.
And now, eleventh will say vidya and avidya together grant immortality. Now,
wha..., what does this mean exactly? Here, if you see, first, if we just look
at, vi..., v..., avidya and vidya, straightforward way, then it will seem very
confusing, even contradictory. So, we discussed how avidya and vidya mean
different things. Let us look at that once again. And then we will understand
what vidya and avidya mean, and the eleventh verse that we are going to study
today.

So, so, in the ninth mantra, avidya means ignorant pursuit of sense
gratification. A person does not know what any higher values of life, that is
why the person chases after sense gratification. There, vidya refers to it, so
called vidya. It refers to having knowledge and using one, that knowledge to
pursue sense gratification. So, that will take up a, it will make a person do
more damage because the intelligence will be used to create suffering, in a more
sophisticated way for oneself, through greater pursuit of sense gratification.
Now, in the tenth mantra, avidya refers to both, what was referred to in ninth.
It refers to knowledge for pursuing sense gra..., sense gratification. That
means it includes, both the ignorant pursuit and the knowledge of pur...,
pursuit with knowledge. Both are included in sense gratification. And vidya
refers to knowledge for pursuit of Krishna Consciousness. So, one result is
obtained by this and another by this. Now, in eleventh mantra, avidya refers to
not knowledge for the pursuit of sense gratification, but knowledge for bodily
maintenance. And here, vidya refers to knowledge for the pursuit of Krishna
Consciousness. So, let us look mantra:

        vidyāṁ cāvidyāṁ ca yas
        tad vedobhayaṁ saha
        avidyayā mṛtyuṁ tīrtvā
        vidyayāmṛtam aśnute

So, "vidyā" and "avidya", "yas tad vedobhayaṁ saha", so, "veda" means to know.
"ubhayam" means both. So, when one knows both, both of these, "vidyā" and
"avidya". That means knowledge for material maintenance and knowledge for
spiritual advancement. Then, what will happen by it? "avidyayā mṛtyuṁ tīrtvā",
the cycle of birth and death, this death that is there, journey in this life,
that is there, for that, we need material knowledge. So, when we have material
knowledge, we would be nagi..., navigating the journey of life. And then
"vidyayāmṛtam aśnute", by "vidya", one will attain eternal existence. If I am in
an ocean, I need to know two things. I need to know how to ride the boat in the
ocean. And then, I need to know where the land is, and get to the land. If I
just know how to get to the land, but I do not know how to take the boat towards
the land. I need to have some basic knowledge about the boat. So, without that,
even if I know where the land is, I will not be able to get there. So, if one
has only spiritual knowledge, and one does not have basic knowledge for bodily
maintenance, at least, then one will not be able to live in this world. And one
has to live, so that one can ultimately attain the destination. So, both
material and spiritual knowledge are important. But better knowledge is not the
knowledge of how to become happy in this world, but it is to, how to live
fruitfully in this world. How to live so as to fulfill the purpose of the world.

So, both when we have, so knowledge of the riding the boat takes us through the
ocean. And knowledge where the land is takes us to the land. Similarly, material
knowledge helps us to navigate with the problems of life. But, what, what is the
ultimate purpose of navigating the problems of life? What is it that ultimately
I am meant to achieve. We cannot solve the problems of life at a material level.
But if we live intelligently, then we can arise our consciousness and go beyond
these problems, ultimately back to the spiritual world. So, let us look at Srila
Prabhupada's translation.

"Only one who can learn the process of nescience and that of transcendental
knowledge side by side can transcend the influence of repeated birth and death
and enjoy the full blessings of immortality."

So, "full blessings of immortality", "āmṛtam aśnute". So, both have to be
cultivated side by side. That is what Srila Prabhupada says. And the translation
based on the mantra. Now, let us look at the overview of the purport. So, this
is a long purport among the longest in this book, Isopanisad with fourteen
paragraphs in it. And Srila Prabhupada in the first five paragraphs tells about
how immortality is impossible materially.

Then, he describes immortality is possible only by following Krishna's
teachings. And then he describes how, what these teachings are, and how these
teachings can be applied briefly.

Then, he says, actually, the Krishna Himself descends from the spiritual world
to material world to make us immortal. So, now, actually, how this is, the title
immortality is possible only by following Krishna's teaching. That is like a
mega title, or a big title. And the remainings are subtitles. So, six to seven
is Krishna comes to make us immortal.

And then, how do we become immortal? Krishna is teaching us the process, first
thing is, sense gratification binds us to mortality, so restrict it.

Then, apara dharma teaches us how to balance our material side and the spiritual
side. That is in two paragraphs.

And then the last three paragraphs talk about how para dharma grants
immortality.

So, in this way, Srila Prabhupada is giving us a systematic overview of the
process, how by, by which we will attain, "vidyayāmṛtam aśnute". We will attain
immortality. Now, why is it impossible to attain immortality materially? Srila
Prabhupada gives us scriptural example and then he gives a logical analysis also
briefly. The scriptural example he gives is that of Hiranyakasipu. Hiranyakasipu
uses full intelligence, that enormous austerity, got the kind of power which
none of us can even ever get, but inspite of all that, in one moment, everything
was destroyed.

        kalatmano panayama nija vrutya parsom

Prahlada Maharaja says, my dear Lord, I saw that in one moment, "kalatmano
panayama", that by the power of time, by you manifesting as time, what happened
is, everything was destroyed, and therefore, I do not consider any of these
things valuable. They are all temporary. No matter, even if one gets opulence,
to the extent, not just of Indra, but to the extent of Brahma, still that will
be of no use. Actually, it is only the association of devotees, and through the
association of devotees, that one gets devotional service. "nija vrutya parsom",
that is a factual value. So, Hiranyakasipu demonstrates to us through his
negative example of what will not get grant immortality. There is some le...,
anecdote of Ravana. Ravana when he was going around and this universe,
desecrating campaign, he was going around conquering the universe and wherever
he would g..., find some beau..., beautiful da..., woman, he would desecrate
them, or abduct them. He would defy them. So, when he was doing all this, he saw
Narada Muni around. Now, Narada was associated with the sages, with the Lord,
with, and with the Gods. So, he thought Narada is my enemy. And he decided to
kill Narada. Now, when he started shooting Narada, at that time, what happened?
All the arrows that he shot, the arrows which even the Gods could not withstand, the
arrows, which he caused Gods to flow or flee, those arrows just went into
Narada's body and they just disappeared in Narada's body. And Ravana used all
his formidable weapons and nothing happened. Finally, Ravana saw boredom. He
says, what is this person? How has he got so much power? He says, oh, Narada,
please come. And he just come down. It were, the idea of, the strategy of demons
is, if you cannot conquery somebody, befriend that person. So, they can just
change their faith, their attitude, depending on what will favor the sense
gratification. He says, oh, this was so powerful. Maybe, I can find out what is the
secret of his power is? Called Narada, please come in, please come in, have a
seat. Narada sat down. He said, you know, he said, you are a great sage, please
tell me how is it that none of my weapons are affecting you. He says, because
simple, because I have a spiritual body. He says, spiritual body, what is that?
It is, spiritual body means that is eternal. That is indestructible. He says
I want that. How can I get it? He says, simple. He says, I am chanting the names
of the Lord. You start chanting the names of Lord, become His devotee. And He
will give you spiritual body in future. He said, I cannot do that. Get lost.
So, he says, no, I do not want to do that.

So, the demoniac mentality is that there is an authorised way of get
immortality, that is become devoted to God, raise to the spiritual level of
consciousness, and there, one will attain immortality. But the demoniac
mentality is they want immortality, but without the consciousness, that will
take one to immortality. They want immortality at the material level. Now,
Hiranyakasipu, Ravana, they were all, failed. Now, today, there are atheistic
people, materialistic people, who try to also get immortality. Now, essentially,
Srila Prabhupada explains that mystic power and scientific power are similar.
Because both are ultimately attempts to manipulate material nature. Mystic power
taps into the higher sources of energy that are there among the higher beings of
the universe. So, Ravana does austerities. Hiranyakasipu does authorities, and
gets powers from the higher beings. Scientific power comes from not
acknowledging any higher beings, even the Supreme Lord, nor His representatives,
but recognising the power of nature, trying to figure out how that power of
nature is working, and then trying to catch that power for oneself. But
essentially, the idea motivating mystic power and scientific power in many ways
are similar. That both are attempts to control material nature. Srila Prabhupada
tells in his Nectar of Des..., Devotion, Intru..., Instruction that a, yogic
siddhis are similar to much of modern scientific technology. The yogis fly. And
sci..., with science, we fly using airplanes. Essentially, the activity is
similar. The activity is do in material nature, with material nature, what we
are not normally able to do. So, today, people do not believe in mystic powers,
mostly. And they almost entirely do not have access to mystic powers. So, today,
people are diverting all their efforts, to control material nature, towards
scientific and technological power.

So, is it possible that by future scientific advancement one will be able to
attain immortality at a material level? You know, there is a huge hype about
this. But Srila Prabhupada gives a simple reasoning why it is not possible, why
material immortality is impossible, because matter undergoes six changes. And
these six changes in matter are unstoppable, even incomprehensible. Uns...,
in..., unstoppable means we cannot check them. And incomprehensible means we
cannot even understand them. And wha..., how do we understand that we cannot
understand? That is ensouled matter. This is the word that I have used because
scientists often use the word living matter. But actually, our philosophy says
that matter is never living. We could say matter that has apparent life. So,
ensouled matter, that means matter where soul is present. Consciousness is
present. It undergoes three extra changes which ordinary matter does not. It
grows. It reproduces. It preserves itself. Whereas ordinary matter does not do
that. Ordinary matter, it is, it is created. Since after its creation, it just
exists. Next phase is it deteriorates. And finally, it is destroyed. You know,
if we create a house, the first phase is it is created. If we live it as it is,
by the passage of time, by the effect of the elements of nature, it will
deteriorate. And ultimately, it will be destroyed. So, ordinary matter, it
basically undergoes th..., these three phases of its existence, creation,
deterioration, destruction.

Now, as in contrast with this, if we see matter which scientists call as living,
living matter. Actually, from our philosophical perspective, it is oxymoron.
Oxymoron means two words, which are brought together, which are contradictory in
meaning. So, for example, if somebody says, that person is a chaste prostitute.
You know, if somebody is a prostitute, how can somebody be chaste? Or say, that
person is a courageous coward. How can somebody be courageous and coward?
Similarly, these are oxymorons. So, living matter, from our perspective is an
oxymoron. Because matter itself is defined as having no consciousness. So, we do
not, but matter in which life is manifest, so like our bodies right now. The
bodies are phased living beings. So, they have some further phases to their
existence. It is not just creation, deterioration, destruction. In addition to
this, there is growth. You know, if I keep a laptop here for twenty years, the
laptop, if it has a particular size screen, it will not go into a bigger screen.
It just stays as it is. If I have a house of a particular area, it will not grow
into bigger area. So, non, non-living matter, actually all matter is non-living,
but inanimate matter, non-ordinary matter does not undergo any growth. Whereas,
wherever there is life, there is growth. Small baby grows. A plant grows. Even my
crops grow. Now, not only is there growth, there is also reproduction. There is
no such reproduction in ordinary matter. You know, sometimes, we may call, if we
have some tools, a carpenter may say that if one part fits into another part, he
may say this is the male part. This is the female part. But it is not that the
male and female come together and produce other, other tools. That does not
happen. So, actually speaking, all that is there is, just a nomenclature is
there, but essentially, when there is living, the living things, and they are,
they are, they are reproduced. The male-female, in what species they are, they
are reproduced. In some exceptional cases, when some soul has done such sinful
activities that a soul is not even given the fac.., faculty for sexual
enjoyment, facility for sexual enjoyment. Then in those cases, there may be
other sexual reproduction among some very, or some organism with reduced
consciousness. But either way, there is reproduction. Now, matter does not
reproduce. Whereas, actually, where there is life, where there is soul present,
there is reproduction.

And then, beyond that, there is preservation. Preservation means, you know, if I
take this watch, I cut it, cut off the handle of the watch. Now, the belt, if it
is cut off, it will just stay cut off. Now, there is no blood clotting process
that will happen by which it will start healing itself. On the other hand, if I
take a knife, tuck, and cut my hand over here. There will be bleeding. But
afterwards, there will be clotting and heal itself. So, m..., whenever there is
life.  And then life is present in the body, that body tries to heal itself.
That preseves itself.

So, growth, reproduction, preservation, these are things which differentiate
between ordinary matter and ensouled matter. They are in one sense the physical
symptoms of the presence of the soul. Now, scientists may have some mechanisms
about clotting happens. How growth happens. How reproduction happens. But
mechanisms are essentially hows. They are not whys.  There is a fundamental
difference between hows and whys. Hows is the mechanism of how something
happens. Why is the purpose. Why does that happen? So, why does this kind of
matter that makes a laptop not reproduce or mai..., preserve itself, or grow?
And why such a matter that is present in a living person, grow, reproduce and
preserve? So, the point is these changes are largely incomprehensible. So, we do
not even understand them. What to speak of stopping them? If you cannot
understand them also, is there real chance of stopping them? And this is happens
by the work of material nature. So, now, there are many researchers or
especially business men who make business out of research claims, who say that
in the future, you know, you will never grow old, or rather, we have got a
medicine by which you will again become young. So, actually speaking, is it
possible that somebody can become young? No. Why is it not possible? Because
essentially, this body is something which we cannot control. You know,
researchers have found out that, you know, the cells in the body are in constant
state of flux. So, new are created and old are destroyed. But somehow, as an
organism keeps growing, then they find that, the num..., there is a number of
cells that are reproduced, are less than the number of cells that are destroyed.
You know, that is how aging takes place. You know, they are trying to find out
are there some gens that control this? They found, maybe there is one gen. So,
if we can just find that gen, and then take out that gen, or deactive that gen,
then the decrease in the self-reproduction will not happen. And then the person
can stay on forever. So, people tried this. But this does not work because they
could not isolate any gen like that. And eventually, they said, now, c..., the
current opinion is there is a whole network of genetic mechanisms, which causes
the decrease in the growth of the cells, reproduction of the cells. They say if
you now try to deactivate this whole mechanism, so, all kind of disruption in the
bodily structure will happen. So, we cannot do that. So, the International
Genelotogical Association which made an announcement that, you know, there is no
technology, there is no medicine, there is no surgery, there is no therapy of
any kind at all that can either reverse, stop, or slow the aging process. We
cannot reverse it. That means we cannot make old person young. We cannot
slow it. Whatever age a person is going to grow old, the person will grow old
at that age. And we cannot stop it also. Everybody has to grow old. So, what can
we do? We cannot do anything at all. We can just do something cosmetic. The hair
has become black. We can try to make it... Hair has become white. We can make it
black. Some wrinkles on the face. We can try to remove the wrinkles. Some tooth
has fallen out. We can put in the teeth. But this is all cosmetic. It does not
improve the inner health of the body.

Now, Srila Prabhupada says in a lecture, you know the material nature will
quietly, helplessly make all of us old. And when Srila Prabhupada was on a
morning walk, and once a young man said, Swami, why do we have to, why do we
have to bow down to God? He says, why does, he says, Prabhupada said, forget
God. You know, you have to bow down to material nature. He says, no, I do not
have to bow down to anyone. He says, will you not have to grow old? He says,
you know, that is simply biology. Nobody can force me, he was saying that,
nobody can force me to bow down. Nobody can force me to submit to anything. He
says, won't you have to grow old? He says, yes. Then, you are forced to grow
old. He says, no, no, no, that is simply biological nature. That Prabhupada says
that means biological force. Do you want to grow old? That still, you have to
grow old. That means, it is biological force. So, biological force means that
the biology of the body is such that it forces us to grow old. Basically, we
have to submit. We may not believe in God, but we have to submit to some higher
principle which makes us do things against our will. So, material nature is too
powerful for us to control and it is not going to allow itself to be manipulated
so that human beings can counter the basic principle of material existence. That
is mortality. So, we cannot avoid death. Death is inevitable. No matter how much
we may try, we might get lots of technological advancements. But we should not
let those technological advancements deceive us. There are technological
advancements of different natures. So, making a, we had a computer of this size.
And now we have a computer of this size. This is basically manipulating nature
within a particular zone. We are not changing the nature of nature. 23:07
