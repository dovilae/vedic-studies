Hare Krishna.

Welcome back to our Isopanisad course. We are discussing the thirteenth mantra
purport. So, today, I will focus on one theme from this thirteenth mantra
purport. Which we have not discussed until now in a systematic way. Although, we
have discussed it in an overview way. So, here are we, the topic that we will be
discussing is that like people who do not excl..., accept Krishna as sambhavat,
for them, they say that people are my God. So, people are my God.

This was when Srila Prabhupada had come to India with his western disciples. At
that time, there was a famous politician. He had said that people are my God.
And at one level, that had given a lot of popularity. Because the idea that I am
the servant of the people. And he just says some people worship God. I will
worship the general people. That had attracted a lot of public appreciation. But
Srila Prabhupada excoriated that person. He said that we cannot make people into
God. God is God. And people are not God. So, this idea is quite deep rooted that
serving people is service to God. So, today, we will explore it, first from a
sociological perspective. Then from a philosophical perspective. And then from a
practical perspective. Where we integrate the philosophical analysis with the
sociological analysis. So, this is actually a separate representation that I
give on manava seva, madhava seva. And because this topic is important, not just
from the point of view of this purport, or this book. But it is important in
terms of how we present Krishna Consciousness in the world. And how we ourselves
understand Krishna C..., the importance of Krishna Consciousness in our lives.
We will discuss this topic in detail. So, this is manava sevahi, madhava sevahi.
So, is manava seva not madhava seva? That is what we will try to discuss here.
So, this is the overview. So, Prabhupada had prepared long ago.

So, let the facts speak. We will discuss what the facts are. Then, we will look
at Greed causes starvation. How can greed be removed. The secret of compassion.
Are good enough, good intentions good enough?

So, now, why do people think that manava seva is madhava seva? So, manava seva
means service to human beings. Madhava seva is service to God. So, people say
that service to man is service God. Or in today's gender neutral vocabulary,
service to humanity is service to God. Now, this seems to be very popular idea.
But if we look at it objectively, what is the reality? At first glance, many
movies talk about this. Many social critics talk about this. They say that you
people are spending so much money inside the temples. Now, they are, on the
stones in the temples. And outside, there are poor beggars who are starving. Why
don't you use that same money to feed the poor people? So, certainly, poor
people should be fed. No doubt. But is it that the money being spent inside is
the cause of the starvation outside? At an immediate superficial level, you
could ju..., we could just say that, oh, instead of spending money, just spend
money here. But beggars are not just starving outside the temples. Beggars are
starving on the, in the slums, on the streets everywhere. Beggars are sta...,
sta..., beggars will be starving outside the houses of the billionaires and
trillionaires also. But quite often, they have security around. And they would
drive the beggars away. So, it is not that beggars are only outside the temple.
And if you are going to look at starvation, why emotionally manipulate people by
contrasting the starvation outside the temple with the opulence with which
deity is worshipped inside? Why not contrast the starvation with the beggars with
the thousands and thousands of dollars that are spent on cricket, on movies, on
so many frivolous events. We have nothing against cricket or movies per say. Of
course, they are mundane. They are passionate. They are distracting from
spiritual life. But the point is, if we compare, comparatively speaking, you
know, spending millions of rupees on just watching one cricket match. In that
much money, how many po..., poor people could have been, you know, served. How
many poor people could have been, you know, fed. How many starving people could
have got so many means. As a matter of perspective, actually, the, the unicef
studies have shown that, all the starving people in the world can be fed, ju...,
if just the money that is spent by the European Union and America on perfumes,
were used for feeding on starving people.

So, who, actually speaking, if you want to contrast, why not contrast this way?
So, that contrast, what does it indicate people? I want to smell God. So that I
can attract others. Even if for my sake of my smelling good, other people have
to starve to death. It does not matter. This contrast is very uncomfortable for
us. Because it interferes with our sense gratification. Whereas when you
contrast, you know, people, b..., starving people outside, the, outside the
temple with the people who are worshipping in the temple inside, what does it
do? It makes us f..., feel, in some way, superior to those who are going to the
temple and worshipping. And it exempts us from the responsibility of going to
the temple and worshipping. So, certainly, the goal is not that people ju...,
in, not justying starving at all. You know, it is the duty of those who are
prosperous to help those who are poor. But to c..., man..., manipulate in this
way the emotions of people against God is misleading, is profoundly misleading.
Not only is it misleading, it does not solve the problem fundamentally. So, let
us look at the facts. As I said here. So, these statistics might be a little
old. Figures might change slightly. But the point remains the same. And is what?

To satisfy the world's sanitation and food requirements would cost only US $13
billion - what the people of the United States and the European Union spend on
perfume each year!

So, actually speaking, we see that this cause of starvation is not so much a,
the, the money that is spent on temple. The money that is spent so much on
frivolous activities. So, when people identify with the body, they want to
decorate the body. When people identify with the mind, they want to titillate
the mind. And for the sake of titillating the mind, they will watch sports. They
will watch movies. They will spend millions, billions on entertainment. So, if
people rose to the spiritual platform. Then, they would not identify so much
with the body or with the mind. And then they would not have to spend so
frivolously and excessively on pandering the body in the mind. And then that
money for also needed the direct service of God. So, it is very superficial and
misleading to say because people are doing madhava seva. People are doing
service to God, that is why people are starving outside. This is misleading
propaganda at the very least. Now, if we look at it deeper, there are several
issues involved. If, if people became God conscious. What all would happen? Now,
if people became God conscious, one aspect of God consciousness would be, they
would see all living beings as the children of God. Many people say that, why do
you, why do you see God only in the temple? Why don't you see God in the beggars
who are all around? You know, fine. We are, we can tell them ok. Wh..., leave
alone seeing God in the beggars outside the temple. Why don't you see God in the
slaughterhouses where all the animals are being slaughtered? You know, is God
not present there with them, in their hearts? If God is everywhere, is He there
only in the human heart? Not in the heart of the animals? He is there
everywhere. Why not see Him there? And actually if people were truly God
conscious instead of just minimising God consciousness in the name of serving
poor people, then the truth God consciousness would reflect the change in their
diet. They would not be non-vegetarian. They would be vegetarian. And if they
became vegetarian, what would happen by that? A lot of difference would happen.
You know, when large percentage, in many countries, more than fifty percent of
the land, that could be used for growing grains for feeding human beings is used
instead to grow further to feed the animals, who are then eaten by human beings.

Now, the problem with this is, it is a very inefficient process. With this much
grains, if human beings eat it, so man, human, human beings fed for a good
amount of time. But that much grain, say, if it is used to feed a, an animal. Then,
that animal, most of it will be eaten, and most of it will be passed out as its
refuse. And a little from this much grain, may be a little bit of, of flesh will be
increased. And then, in that flesh, human beings will eat. So on an average, the
researchers have said that the amount of land that is required to feed one
non-vegetarian person, that could be used to feed so many vegetarian people. So
many, or, it can, that the statistics vary from five to fifteen. But all
statistics agree that the same amount of land can feed many many more vegetarian
people. So, the implication of this is, if we are serious about removing
starvation, become vegetarian. If become, if people become vegetarian, then the
immediate result of that will be so much of the land which is used to feed
animals, can be used to, to grow further to feed animals who are slaughtered,
who are artificially era..., raised, and fattened, and then slaughtered. It
could be used to feed human beings. And so many strong starvation could be
avoided. In fact, according to some statistics, several times the planet's
population can be fed, if all the land available for revegetation would be used
for making grains for human beings.

Similarly, if, so, people drink. Now, they think it is modern. It is fashionable
to drink. And those people who drink, do not drink alcohol, they see as people
are so primitive, so prohibitive. Enjoy life. But have these people thought
those people who drink, who say cheers. Have they thought that their cheers are
the cause of tears in the eyes of the starving people? How? Because when they
drink alcohol, what happens? Alcohol does not pop out of the air. Alcohol comes
from a sugarcane. And sugarcane has to be grown in the fields. So, so many
fields, all over the world practically, it is used to grow sugarcane or other
kinds of elements that are used for various intoxicated drinks. And that land
could have been used to grow grains. So, because that land has not used to grow
grains, so, therefore, you know, people starve. So, if, all the people in the
world stopped drinking alcohol, so much of the land could be saved from being
used for sugarcane farming. It could be used for grain farming and so people
could be fed again also. So, and, we see, when people become truly God
consciousness. They will stop eating meat. And they will stop drinking alcohol.
So, at a much deeper level, God consciousness solves the problem of starvation
in a far more fundamental way. In a far more far reaching way than just asking
one person who is worshipping God in a temple to feed the poor outside. This is
a very superficial simpli..., simplistic sort of, you know, point the finger at
other solution, which does not solve any problems. So, therefore, we have to
understand the issue seriously. So, yes, it is not that, God should not be. That
God should be worshipped. And God's children should be neglected. An ideal
culture would be where God is also glorified. And His children are also cared
for. And that is possible if people become more selfless, become more
spiritually minded. It will not happen be..., if people become more selfish
and more materially minded.

So, now, here again, we see greed. The real problem is not, you know, any kind
of God consciousness, or shortage of natural resources. Nearly one in four billion,
1.3 billion, a majority of humanity live on less than one dollar per day. This
is, few, as I said, while the world's 358 billionaires have assets exceeding the
combined annual incomes of countries with 45% of the world's people. So, money
is concentrated on few people. The problem is greed. So, there are some people
who are just chopping off the earth and eating it. While others are getting just
some uchist, you know, some refuse, remnants from the dirty mouth of greedy
materialists. Now, sometimes, people say there is starvation because of droughts
and famines.

But the problem is that much of the world's best land is being misused for the
production of cash export crops. A study of famines in Africa showed that on
every occasion the affected nation had within its own boundaries the food
resources to feed its starving citizens, but relief was intentionally withheld
due to economic or political motives. So, this is from book Food Force by
Frances Lappe Moore. And this is quoted by devotees Andatta Karma Prabhu and
M..., Mukunda Maharaja, Michael Cremo or Michael Grant in their book, Divine
Nature. So, again, why are we discussing all this in Isopanisad? Isopanisad says
that when we worship anything other than God, ano..., one results comes. And
when we, one result, worship God, another result comes.

    anyad evāhuḥ sambhavād
    anyad āhur asambhavāt

So, a popular "asambhavāt", a popular object of worship today, at least
notionally, you know, as a substitute for God is people, is humanitarian work.
So, we are saying now, the real problem is not just shortage of natural
resources. It is not wastage of natural resources on God. It is actually
mismanagement caused by greed. So, now, wh..., actually speaking, so many more
people can be fed if life is taken, if people are truly taken care of in a
proper way. How are they taken care of in proper way? By providing them God
consciousness. And if they are provided God consciousness. Then, there, they
will not be so self-centered. They will not be so shortsighted. And they will
care for others. And that was actually the culture that was there in India
thanks to its spiritual foundation. That was there. So, when we move forward.

What is the cause of starvation? It is greed. When people become godless, they
concomitantly become materialistic and greedy. And so exploit nature and their
fellow human beings for selfish enjoyment. So, yes, we are looking now that
starvation is a problem. But what is the cause? The cause is greed. And what is
the cause of greed? It is godlessness. Similarly, we can look at it from another
way. We may feed a few hungry people, but till we remove greed from wealthy
people's heart, hunger will continue to torment millions.

So, the problem is not so simple that some beggars are starving and we give them
food. And that will be, you know, that will be definitely helping, but a little
bit help for a very little time. A far more fundamental solution is purify
people's heart of greed. When their hearts are purified, naturally, they will be
able to do much more for humanity. The problem in this world is not shortage of
food. It is shortage of compassion. And shortage of compassion is there because
there is excess of greed. And excess of greed is there because people think that
material things will make us happy. So, I want to accu..., accumulate more, and
more, and more material things. But when people understand that, actually it is 
my connection with God that will make me happy. And therefore, I need to connect
with God as much as possible. Then, that was what will actually make me happy.
And then I want to run after material things so f..., passionately, so
insensitively, so recklessly, not mindful of the cost that it is inflicting on
others.

So, now, how can greed be removed? When people are offered spiritual education
and experience, they understand that their real happiness is in loving God, not
in accumulating material things. Then they give up greed. So, this is what
spirituality offers. So, actually speaking, when each of us, when we are
chanting Hare Krishna and then we are sharing Krishna Consciousness with others,
we are not just doing some religious ritual. We are actually participating in a
process that is transforming us positively and is going to transform others
positively when we share it with them. And by that, we are making tangible
contributions in this world also. And, this is how we are helping in solving the
problems of the world through the practice of God consciousness.

So, let us move forward now. How do we actually develop compassion? By going
closer to God. Because when we go closer to God, then naturally, what happens?
As here that we see, Mother Theresa was asked. What is the secret of your
compassion? She pointed to her rosary beads and said "By praying, I feel love
for God and all His children and so want to help them as much as I can". So, the
vision of a true spiritualist is that such a pers..., spiritualist, sees God in
all living beings. But not at a, as a, as an idealistic way that everybody is
God. But everybody is a child of God. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, in Sixth
Chapter, 32 verse, He says:

    ātmaupamyena sarvatra
    samaṁ paśyati yo ’rjuna
    sukhaṁ vā yadi vā duḥkhaṁ
    sa yogī paramo mataḥ

He says that, by comparing all people with oneself, one sees the true equality
of all living beings, in their happiness and in their distress. And thereby, a
person wants to help them. So, this is compassion. And this comes when we become
spiritually evolved. So, spiritual advancement is a way of not just doing good
to oneself, but it is also doing good to the whole world. Because we are helping
remove greed from the hearts of people. So, now, there are many people who may
want to help. Ok, now, we discussed. From one perspective is, the perspective
of, so there is a problem of starvation in society. What is the cause of
starvation? One f..., pro..., cause is that there are greedy people who are
exploiting others. How do we remove the greed from their hearts? By offering
them spiritual education experience by which they will decrease their
infatuation with material things and find non-material nourishment. The other
is that there are poor people who are starving. But often, these poor people who
are starving, they have their own set of inadequacies, not just the shortage
that they are having because of sta..., that they are starving. Sometimes, they
are addicted to bad ha..., they have, addicted to liquor. They are addicted to
other bad habits. And even if they get money, they often misuse the money.

Now, before I was introduced to Krishna Consciousness, I used to, I was quite
interested in social service. So, when I was in my college, at that time, just
near our college, there was some slums. So, I would go there. And I would teach
to the slum children. So, I would teach them English, Math, and other subjects.
The idea was that literacy is the key to a good future for our fellow citizens.
So, I was going there for some time. And I had a friend who was much more into
this. And he would go to a village, and then that village, he would go and
maintain education for the children. And then we were discussing, and we
realised that the children, we are coming once a weekend, once a week, or twice
a week, or whatever, and what we are educating them. But the children are
influenced much more by the culture around them, most of all, their parents. And
generally, their parents, especially the father would be a drunkard. So, then,
we started talking 21:56
