Hare Krishna.

So, now we start with the eighth verse of the Isopanisad. This is the last verse
in the second section. And in this second section, we are understanding how to
understand the Ishvara who p..., possesses inconceivable attributes. So, let us
look at the section overview quickly. So, four to eight section was understand
Ishvara with spiritual vision. The first part of that, that was, four to five,
how Ishvara has inconceivable attributes. Six to seven was first develop
spiritual vision towards worldly objects, things, events, and then direct that
spiritual vision towards the Supreme Lord, towards that Absolute Truth and
understand Him. This vision developed further and directed to the Ishavara helps
us to understand Him.

So, this is actually not a translation. This is a summary which gives a
inclining of the flow which gives an overall understanding of the flow. So, let
us look at the verse now. Let us see what the mantra actually says.

        sa paryagāc chukram akāyam avraṇam
        asnāviram śuddham apāpa-viddham
        kavir manīṣī paribhūḥ svayambhūr
        yāthātathyato 'rthān vyadadhāc chāśvatībhyaḥ samābhyaḥ

So, "sa paryagāc chukram", so "sa" refers to that person. Who is that person?
The seeker. So that person was referred to in the previous two verses that such
a person sees equally, "ātmaivābhūd vijānataḥ", such a person who sees everybody
as spiritual, as soul, as parts of God, now, how does that person see God? "sa
paryagāc", such a person should be able to see like this. "chukram", is
omnipotent, extremely powerful. "akāyam", "akāyam", Prabhupada translates as
unembodied. Let us see what this means. "avraṇam", and who is, cannot, who is
not reproached.

"asnāviram śuddham apāpa-viddham", he has no veins. He is pure. He is not
contaminated by sin. "kavir manīṣī paribhūḥ svayambhūr", so such a person is
"kavir", that means a wise person. "manīṣī" is philosopher. "paribhūḥ" is the
greatest of all. "svayambhūr", self-sufficient.

"yāthātathyato 'rthān vyadadhāc", that means just in pursuance of, just in
proportion to us, which a person offers. "'rthān vyadadhāc", the desirables,
"'rthān", gives, "vyadadhāc", awards. "chāśvatībhyaḥ samābhyaḥ", "chāśvatī"
means eternal, forever. So, from time immemorial, where, this person has been
doing this. "samā" is hindi. "samābhyaḥ" is sanskrit time. So, this person
has understood thus having all these properties. These are characteristics of
the Absolute Truth, there are described in this verse as mahabhagavata
understands the Absolute Truth.

"Such a person must factually know", "sa paryagāc", "the", "the greatest of
all", "sa paryagāc chukram", "akāyam avraṇam", so the Personality of Godhead.
Srila Prabhupada makes it clear in his translation itself that what the verse is
talking about is not an impersonal Absolute. It is the Personality of Godhead,
who is unembodied, "akāyam". "avraṇam asnāviram", he, so, so "avraṇam" is beyond
reproach, "asnāviram", without waves. "asnāviram śuddham apāpa-viddham",
"asnāviram" is without waves, pure and uncontaminated. "śuddham apāpa-viddham".
Then "kavir manīṣī paribhūḥ svayambhūr", so "kavir manīṣī" is philosopher,
self-sufficient is "svayambhūr", and then "yāthātathyato 'rthān vya", so
"paribhūḥ", the greatest of all. Srila Prabhupada has put first and foremost in
the translation, such a person must factually know the greatest of all. So,
"paryagāc chukram", and "paribhūḥ", Prabhupada has put both of them together
here, "the self-sufficient philosopher who has been fulfilling everyone's desire
since time immemorial.", "vyadadhāc chāśvatībhyaḥ samābhyaḥ".

So, let us look at the overview of the, we will see that, so, "akāyam" is
unembodied, and "asnāviram" is without veins. So, what does it mean? That we
will look at the significance of these two verse in combination later. Then,
"chukram", so the first two paragraphs talk about the Absolute Truth is
unembodied and without veins, and omnipotent, "shukram", that is described in
paragraph two to four. So, when a paragraph comes in both, that means in the
middle of the paragraph, that point changes. And the next point starts being
developed. And the fulfiller of desires, that is five to six paragraphs.
Paribhuh is Supreme described in seventh paragraph. Svayambhuh is described in
the eighth paragraph. And Shuddham Apapa Vidham, antiseptic and prophylactic is
described in the eighth paragraph.

So, let us look at all this one by one. So, now, this seems to be the most clear
point that the Absolute Truth is impersonal. How can one infer that? One word
that might lead to the inferences, "akāyam". "akāyam". Now, "kāyam" means body.
"akāyam" means without body. So does "akāyam" actually mean this or does it have
some other meaning? Let us look at it now. So, there is a famous verse in the
Svetasvatra Upanishad, which also comes in the part of the vedas. So, "na tasya
pratima asti". So, many people who want to try to prove that Absolute Truth has
no form. They start to quote this verse and they say that Absolute Truth has no,
not a separate "pratima asti", no representation of that Absolute Truth. So,
actually speaking, if we look at the full context of the U..., Svetasvatra
Upanishad where this comes, "No one can grasp Him above, across, or in the
middle. There is no likeness of Him. His name is Great Glory.".

So, actually what is said over here is not that he does not have a form. There
is no likeness of Him. And Baladeva Vidhyabhusan gives the translation, you
know, in a more explicit way. He says "na tasya pratima asti" means nothing can
compare with the transcendental form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So,
the Lord's form is so great, "pratima", He is so great that nothing can compare
with it. So, now, sometimes, the Lord's form is compared for giving us an idea
of what it means. So, for example, sometimes, it may be said that the Lord's
eyes are like lotus. His face, His lips are like bimba fruit. Now, these are
just given as indications for us to get some idea. But in the Lalita-Madhava,
which is written by Rupa Goswami, a devotee king is glorifying the Supreme Lord.
He said my dear Lord, in the past, I thought that I was glorifying you with
choice poetry, but now of that I have actually beheld your beautiful form, now I
understand that what I spoke earlier was not actually glorification. That was
actually an insult. Because it is like glorifying the emperor of the world to be
the landlord of the village. So, actually, you are so much greater than any
glorification that we can offer. That the glorification we offer becomes like an
insult for you. Because the glorification becomes like a minimisation.

So, in this way, the great devotees, when they get experience of the Lord's
beauty and they understand it is so great that nothing compares with it, "na
tasya pratima asti". So, this sort of negative descriptions that are there,
which sometimes seem to say that the Absolute Truth does not have a form,
have to be understood properly their full context. And they have to be
understood from the acharyas.

So, "akāyam", let us see what it means. So, it will be a major part of the
discussion. So, in general, there has to be a hermeneutic, hermeneutic means a
method of understanding. So, for example, one of the methods of understanding is
"arthapatti". "Arthapatti" means postulation. So, for example, there are two
contradictory statements. If they have to be resolved, one has to think of a
third statement which resolves that. So, if somebody says Ravi does not eat food
throughout the day. And then we find Ravi's weight is increasing. So, these two
statements are contradictory. If the weight, if person is not eating, then how
can the weight increase? Then, we need a third statement, which reconciles the
two. What is that? Ravi eats secretly at night. So, when Ravi eats secretly at
night. Then, both statements are true. Ravi does not eat throughout the day.
Ravi's weight is increasing. So, of course, this is a humorous example. But the
point here is serious that when two statements seem to be contradictory and when
both statements are known to be true. Then, we have to understand that there has
to be a third statement, which reconciles both the statements. And only then can
the truth of both the statements be maintained while resolving the contradiction
between them. So, how does this apply to scriptural study? So, we discussed
earlier about Gajendra's prayers where it, Gajendra is saying:

        arupayoru-rupaya
        nama ascarya-karmane

So, he says that Lord has no form, "arupayo". And he says also it, He has many
forms "u-rupaya". So, how do we understand that both these two can be
reconciled? So, the point is, the, God has no material form. But He has many
spiritual forms. So, the "arthapatti" is, the no form refers to material form.
Many form refers to spiritual form. So, the "arthapatti" is very important
because it is understood in the Vedic hermeneutics. As I mentioned earlier,
hermeneutics is the art of studying and understanding scripture that in herm...,
Vedic hermeneutics, it is understood that the Vedas give us the Absolute Truth.
So, if some statements seems to be contradictory, that is because our
understanding of those statements is incomplete. When we gain a complete
understanding, then those statements will no longer be troublesome for us. We
will be able to see and reconcile them properly. So, how do we do "arthapatti"?
For that, we need guru, sadhu, sastra. Now, if we may say, isn't this just what
we are imposing on scripture? Is this actually the truth of the scripture? Yes,
it is. Let us see how.

So, there is this verse in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, which actually gives
this directly again. So, earlier was from the Bhagavata Purana. Now, it is from
the Shvetashvatara Upanishad:

        apāṇipādo javano grahītā paśyaty acakṣuḥ sa śṛṇoty akarṇaḥ

So, he has no eyes, but he sees. How? So, "paśyaty acakṣuḥ", "paśyaty", he sees,
but "acakṣuḥ", he has no eyes. How is it possible? That "arthapatti", he has
spiritual eyes. He does not see with material eyes. He sees with spiritual eyes.
So, in the Caitanya Caritamrta also, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu does a similar
"arthapatti" in his discussions with both Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya as well as
Prakarshana Sarasvati. There, the Lord makes the point that it is told in the
Vedas that "saha eksatah", that that Absolute Truth glanced, "saha eksatah saha
asrujata", that Absolute truth glanced, and that is, Absolute Truth created. So,
now, only after all the whole creation began, that in a later stage all the
senses come about. When all the senses come later. That means all the eyes will
also come later. So, if all the eyes have come later in the creation, then what
were those eyes which glanced? That started off the creation? So, if all wi...,
eyes are material and all eyes come at a later stage in the unfolding of
creation, then when we say that, the glance, some glance of some eyes started
the creation. What were those eyes? So, those eyes could not have been material
because at that time nothing material was manifest. The mattato was there, only
in an unagitated, unactivated form. So, that means those eyes are
transcendental. So, in this way, we reconcile scripture by postulation.

So, now, Srila Prabhupada, as I said, here, different, "akāyam", he
differentiates the word from unembodied. Srila Prabhupada uses a very specific
translation. He does not use unembodied. He uses, he uses unembodied, not
disembodied. What is the difference between unembodied and disembodied? Body is
the physical body that we, embody means to give a body. So, when the soul is
given a body, the soul becomes embodied. Now, when the soul's body is taken
away, then the soul is said to be disembodied. So, for example, ghosts, ghosts
are disembodied living beings. Disembodied means that they had gross body, but
they beca..., they came, s..., committed suicide, or because of some si...,
similar incident, they lo..., they lost the body. And now, they have not got a
new body. So, the gross body was here. Subtle body and the soul have come out.
And the subtle body and the soul now have no gross body. So, they are called as
disembodied. Disembodied, so what, dis is a negative describer, which says that
something was there, but was taken away. Dispossess, that means somebody had
for some..., possession for something, it was pos..., taken away. So,
disembodied means that which somebody had, but that, what was taken away from
that person.

So, Srila Prabhupada is translating "akāyam" not as bodiless, not even as
disembodied. But he is translating it as unembodied. Unembodied means that the
soul was never, that, that the Absolute Truth rather here, not the soul, the
Absolute Truth was never made embodied. The Absolute Truth eternally has a body.
The soul is here. The body is here. And at the time of conception onwards, the
soul becomes embodied. The soul, to embody means to give a body. To disembody
means to take away the body. But, that is, for the Lord, there is no embodiment.
There is no disembodiment. Why? Because that Lord's body is trancendental. It is
eternally with Him. So, Srila Prabhupada is very meticulously translating
"akāyam" as unembodied. That means there is no conception of the Lord getting
embodied at all. The Lord is eternal, transcendental, and He always His own
transcendental form.

So, then, if that is the case, then why it is the word "akāyam" has to be used
at all to describe the Absolute Truth? 15:36
