Hare Krishna.

Welcome back to our Isopanisad course. We discussed mantra thirteen in three
detailed classes. Where we first discussed about demigod worship. Then, we
discussed about Mayavada. And then, we discussed about social service. So, these
three are the s..., alternatives to Krishna that people can choose as objects of
worship. And we discussed how all of them are ultimately futile. Now, the
Isopanisad goes to the next mantra where it talks about how we can balance. Just
because everything is, everything in the material world is temporary, does not
mean it all has to be rejected. It has to be utilised. So, just as mantra
eleven talked about the balance between vidya and avidya. This mantra will talk
about balance between sambhuti and vinaso..., sambhuti and asambhuti. So, here
the word asambhuti does not refer to just temporary material things. It refers
to that which is used for the service of Krishna in the material realm. So, it
refers to knowledge of this world, which ca..., helps us to become fixed in the
service of Krishna, use it in the Krishna service, service of Krishna and go
back to the spiritual world. So, let us look at the mantra. He says mantra
fourteen:

    sambhūtiṁ ca vināśaṁ ca
    yas tad vedobhayaṁ saha
    vināśena mṛtyuṁ tīrtvā
    sambhūtyāmṛtam aśnute

So, earlier, the word for, was sambhuti and asambhuti. So, here asambhuti is
ref..., re..., replaced by "vināśaṁ". The two are commonates. They are more or
less equivalent words in terms of that implications. Asambhuti is that which is
temporary. "vināśaṁ" is that which is temporary. So, "yas tad vedobhayaṁ saha",
"veda", "ubhayam", when one knows both of these, when, that person become free
from what? "vināśena mṛtyuṁ tīrtvā", that by knowledge of material world, one
will be able to navigate through the material world, through the ocean of
immortality. "sambhūtyāmṛtam aśnute", by sambhuti one will attain immortality.
So, Srila Prabhupada translates this as:

"One should know perfectly the Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His
transcendental name, form, qualities and pastimes, as well as the temporary
material creation with its temporary demigods, men and animals. When one knows
these, he surpasses death and the ephemeral cosmic manifestation with it, and in
the eternal kingdom of God he enjoys his eternal life of bliss and knowledge."

So, Srila Prabhupada translates sambhuti as the Lord along with Nama Rupa Guna
Lila. And then he translates sa..., sa..., "vināśena" as a material creation
with its own variety of living beings.

So, let us look at the purport now. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada basically
talks about, the first two paragraphs is "vināśena". Nothing can make this world
deathless, not even science. When "sambhūtiṁ ca vināśaṁ ca", so Prabhupada's
reasoning in this purport is that this world is temporary. And science also
cannot change the reach out this world. So, then, what can we do? Is there a
realm beyond death? Yes, there is. So, Vedas give us information about the death
filled world and the death free world. The death filled world is this material
world. Death free world is the world beyond. So, Krishna talks about this also
in the Eighth Chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, very contrast, the temporary and
the material, and encourage Arjuna to strive for the eternal. So, from 8.15
onwards until 8.22, He talks about contrast. So, 8.15 is:

        duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam

Then 8.16 is:

        ā-brahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ

Right from Brahma's planet, down to the lowest, all are places of repeated birth
and death. And then He talks about how even Brahman's lifespan ends. And then
from 20 to 22, He talks about the spiritual world. To 8.20, He says:

        paras tasmāt tu bhāvo ’nyo

The another "bhāvaḥ". So, this set of verses, 15 to 22 is illustrating about
Srila Prabhupada is saying over here that the Vedas give information about the
death filled as well as the death free world. Then, "sambhūtyāmṛtam aśnute".
"sambhūtyāmṛtam aśnute" means only by surrender to Krishna can we transcend
death.

So, this is talked about then in a more specific sense in the next verse where
it is, says. We have to give up misconceptions to attain immortality. So, all of
us, we can have various misconceptions. For example, I am the body is a prominent
misconception. I am God is another misconception. So, like that, there are
misconce..., many misconceptions which prevent us from attaining the shelter of
God. So, we have to give up these misconceptions by which we can ultimately
attain immortality. When we attain God, automatically, we attain immortality.

        mām upetya punar janma
        duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam
        nāpnuvanti

When we attain Krishna, and He says in 8.15, then we will not come back to this
world. So, attaining mo..., immortality means attaining Krishna, attaining love
for Krishna. And attaining Krishna thereof. So, in this class, we will primarily
focus on understanding how the world, material world with its variety of
timescales for different living beings, is still ultimately mortal. So, we will
look at the concept of time. Because time is a prominent reality in this world.

        kalo 'smi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho

Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, time I am the destroyer of the world. So, let
us look at this. So, before that, Srila Prabhupada talks about the six, he calls
these are six laws of transformation. We discussed this earlier also in our
discussion on mantra eleven that the living things and the non-living things.
The difference is non-living things basically go through three phases: creation,
deterioration, destruction. Whereas non-living, whereas living things go through
three additional phases: growth, maintenance, reproduction. Along with birth,
depro..., deterioration and death. So, now, Srila Prabhupada in his purport
called these six as the six laws of transformation. Everything material has to
get transformed through these six things. And because of that, because these six
things cannot be stopped, therefore, ultimately, death cannot be stopped. So,
this is how, the, everything in the material world is unstoppably, irreversibly
moving towards destruction and death.

Let us look at the concept of time now to understand how, what is the
implication of this death. So, now, in today's mainstream society, there is the
Judeo-Christian modern scientific time model. What is that? It is a linear
approach from start to the end. So, for example, they say that, one particular
point, there is a creation of universe. And then from there onwards, there is an
appearance of unicellular organisms. Then, it, now it is all speculative,
exactly when it happened, how it happened, nobody knows. And then after some
time, they say there is evolution of human beings. And now, after evolution,
have we attained the peak or is something else going to happen after this? No
one knows that. Maybe, the way life is going. Maybe, we are going to devolve.
Maybe, we are going to get destroyed. So, it is all question. Then, ultimately,
the researchers also say, no that this res..., this world is not eternal. It is
going to be destroyed. So, how it is? It is a linear model. Now, there have been
science religion wars in the west, centered on first the Copernican model where
the Catholic church based on a model of ptolemy, which it had adopted into its
own theology, proposed that the Sun moves around the Earth. So, ptolemy was a
pre Christian Greek thinker who had proposed such a model of the universe. And
the Bible had models adopted. The Bible had thinkers and models, adopted it,
Christian thinkers. And then when Copernicus opposed to, that was a big
confrontation. And then Catholic church took a big beating over there. Because
Galileo's discovery of the telescope, or an invention of the telescope and
subsequent findings, more or less gave very strong empirical evidence for the
idea that the Earth is moving around the Sun, not the Sun around the Earth. Then
after that, there was a big confrontation just went on until Darwin's theory
of evolution. And then, there also, so..., some, religion seem to take a
beating.

So, we may think that religion and science in the west have been in a state of
conflict for almost four hundred years. However, the Judeo-Christian world view
ha..., and the scientific world view have many similarities. Both are linear.
The Judeo-Christian world view had the idea that all of history is moving
towards a particular time. That time was the coming of Jesus, Center Agustine
wrote, was a prominent Christian thinker after Jesus. And he wrote a series of
books in which he tried to prod history, rewrite, reshape history to fit a
linear model. Where everything, all, all events in history were progressing
towards the appearance of Jesus and after the departure of Jesus, now, all the
events are progressing towards the re..., the return of the Messiah. And when
the Messiah returns, at that time, then heavenly paradise on Earth, and all the
sinners will be cast into hell. So, basically, the Christian idea of the
universe was itself a linear model.

Now, before Jesus, and before Agustine's writings, even in Europe, the Greek and
the Roman model of universe was cyclic.  And we see that la..., most of nature
around us, about us, in us is cyclic. We see, the Sun rises. The Sun sets. The
moon has phases, which keep waxing, waning, waxing, waning. The seasons, summer,
rainy season, winter, summer, rainy season. That is in India. Other places, it
might be, you know, might be spring, autumn. The names may be different. But it
is cyclic. You know, we have morning, afternoon, evening, night, morning,
afternoon, evening, night. So, basically, all of nature, we see it moves around
in cycles. So, the, in that sense, the linear view of time, as if time were
arrow progressing towards some particular point was in a sense a Christian idea.

And then science adopted it. And science simply replaced God and Jesus by the
secular God. That is progress. So, evolution theory basically starts from the
idea that in the past everything was regressive. Everything was very simplistic.
There was no life at all in fact. Then, there were microscope organisms. And in
from there, it moved on, moved on, moved on, and then we have human being. We
have a..., animals. And then we have monkeys. And then we have human beings. And
then as the human beings grow, grow, grow, evolve. And then now, we have todays
cellphone using, computer operating, car driving, and all the high-tech
emb..., emblazoned modern person. So, it, it is actually a very self-serving
model of history where we have planted ourselves at the top of history. That we
are like the, we human beings and the modern human beings are the pinnacle of
evolution. And if you think about it, this vision is radically opposed to the
Vedic vision. Not only in the terms that Vedic vision is cyclic and this vision
is linear. But in the cyclic Vedic vision, w..., th..., the current brand of
humanity is not at the top. The current brand of humanity is at the bottom.
There are four yugas. Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dwapar Yuga, Kali Yuga. And in
that Kali Yuga is at the lowest. So, the scientific lo...,  version of history,
or vision of history. It is actually one version, not a true vision. So, that is
basically an outgrowth of the Christian idea of linear time, but with God
replaced by secular concepts, like natural selection, and evolution, and
progress. Essentially, it is the same idea moved forward.

So, as contrasted with that, the Vedic idea is cyclic. Cyclic is, there is
creation, maintenance and annihilation. And then there is creation, maintenance
and annihilation. And once we understand the soul. Then, we understand this goes
on life after life. So, we know that is, what is the basis of the cyclic idea?
We understand that there is a way out of the cycle. Because we know the, above
what you see, above is the spiritual world with, with Goloka Vrindavan at the
top. Then, Vaikuntha is all around it. Then, there is brahmajoti. And below
that, there is a material world. And we see the universe. So, one of the
problems with the cy..., cyclic model is that it appears as if there is no
chance for progress. Because anyway, after morning, there is going to be night
and darkness. Similarly, no matter how much we evolve, after Satya Yuga, there
is going to be Kali Yuga. So, this model seems to le..., leave no room for human
progress. And that is why many western thinkers, they have often thought of
the Vedic literature as very pessimistic and life-denying. However, the Vedic
model does have room for progress, tremendous progress. But that progress is of
a different nature. That is spiritual progress. So, rather than envisioning the
progress in the material realm, as a linear prog..., linear vertical
progression, the Vedic scriptures accept the fact in nature. That at a material
level, what we call progress is basically cyclic. And what is progress now? We
will go down to regress, then again progress. So, in a sense, this vertical is
like a horizontal only. So, it is a wheel here. And it is moving round, and
round, and round. And real progress is not to move towards the top part of the
wheel. Even if one moves to top part, one will have to come back to lower part.
Instead, the progress is get out of the wheel. And there is a spiritual reality,
where is eternal, where it is eternal.

So, w..., actually, human beings cannot live without the concept of progress. We
all want to improve things. A cow can eat the same grass month after month, year
after year, decade after decade. You know, cow does not think, oh, today, I want
to put some masala in the grass. I may have tasted the same thing for so long.
The cow does not want new delicacies. The cow does not have any conception of
progress. You know, it just does its eating, sleeping, mating, defending. We,
human beings, have a more evolved conception of life, more developed
intelligence. And because of that, we want to improve things. So, modern society
by denying the spiritual dimension of reality, restricts the human idea of
progress only to the material level. And in a sense, the last five centuries,
and especially last one and half, two centuries, have seen scientific progress
at a feverish pace. So, as compared to ten years ago, the technology then, and
technology now is phenomenally different. And this progress cannot be denied.
There is progress. But the, but there is an issue with it. Problem with it is
that the human intelligence which could have been used to come out of the cycle
of birth and death has simply been used to just go around in cycle of birth and
death. So, the, at a material level, there might be progress. But at a material
level, ultimately, there is no progress. Because ultimately, everything is going
to be destroyed. So, despite so much progress, we still have problems. We have
used technology. But still, we have stressed people. We have distressed people.
We have suicidal people. We have addicted people. So, now, we may be technology
improved. But psychologically, we have regressed. What to speak of spiritually.
We are definitely regressed onwards.

So, the modern idea of progress by restricting our definition of progress to
progress at the material level has, let us, created this imbalance. Because
people have no idea that they can progress at a spiritual level. What does
progress at a spiritual level mean? It means increasing our understanding
philosophically of spiritual reality. And it means increasing our experience of
spiritual rea..., reality through the process of yoga, centered ultimately on
bhakti yoga. So, this enables to experience spiri..., us to experience
spiritual reality. So, when the Isopanisad is starting that both have to
balance. What does it mean? Do whatever is required for maintenance in the
cyclic material world. But then focus on going beyond this world. So, just like,
fr..., here from the material world to the spiritual world, we want to go.

Now, we will try to understand how the material world, things are cycling
ultimately. So, this is, this may seem a little complex at first glance, but we
can start from the top. So, we see there is a life of Brahma. It is gigantic.
So, three point, three hundred eleven trillion years. Now, what is, happens in
that? So the, at the left is creation to destruction on the top. Now, within
that, if we take one kalpa, one kalpa is one day of Brahma. Brahmaji has a year
of 360 days. So, 36000 kalpas is his life time. So, now, we take one kalpa from
there and we expand it. So, one kalpa is 4.32 billion years. So, now, within
tha..., within that, you know, there are 14 manvantaras and 15 sandhyas.
Manvantara is the time duration of one manu. And in-between two manvantaras,
there is the sandhya. Sandhya is like a joining period. And because it is
in-between two, so there are 15 sandyas. Now, we take one Manvatara and expand
it in the next slide, next part of the slide. And there we will see that one
Manvatara is 306.72 million years. That is 71 divya-yugas. And at the beginning
and at the end of that, there is yuga sandhya. So, juncture, that is 1.728
million years. So, describe what is significance of this 1.728. And then, so
then, one Man..., one Manvantara, there are 71 divya-yugas. One divya-yuga is
one cycle of Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dwapar Yuga, Kali Yuga, one set which
starts with Satya Yuga, ends with Kali Yuga. And again begins with Satya Yuga.
So, now, this is, divya-yuga is 4.32 million years, four yugas combined. In
that, there is Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dwapar Yuga, and Kali Yuga. And in Kali
Yuga, in the five thousand, in the four hundred five thousand years. Right now,
only five thousand years have passed. And that is where we are situated now. So,
what is the age of Brahmaji now? It is fifty first year, first month, first day.
Wha..., what does it mean? That actually, when we calculate his life from the
beginning of the universe. This is the figure that we work out. And as we said,
the seventh Mantavara, and 28th divya-yuga. This is the time when Krishna
appears in this world. So, we modern man, as compared to the vastness of the
universe, we are so small. And we are at this insignificant corner in the
universe. They are technical claims. We just look at this quickly and not read
all of it. We just look at the figure on the corner that you see.

So, every yuga has its yuga sandhya. Kali Yuga has three lap, 60.000 years,
360.000 years as central period. And therein, 36.000 years, that run in the
beginning, 36.000 years at the end. So, they are called as sandhya. And the
sandhya is actually one twelfth the time of the yuga in which it is. That means
if the yuga is, you see, it is 432.000 years, then this becomes 36.000 years.
And both of them together, plus the central period of the yuga, that becomes the
full time of the year, full time period of the yuga. You know, at the end of
each manvatara, there is another Sandhya Kaal when, a great flood wipes out most
life on earth. At the end of the kalpa, all life on earth, is destroyed but the
planets continue to exist. The souls of individuals also continue to exist to be
reincarnated in the next daytime of Brahma. You know that. So, not all souls are
either liberated, definitely not. Those souls who remain, they can go to Brahma
loka. Now, at the end of a life of Brahma, that is Maha-Pralaya. First is called
Naimittika, smaller Pralaya. The whole universe is destroyed. The point of this
is:

        a-brahma-bhuvanal lokah
        punar avartino 'rjuna

Everything in the world is destroyed. This is, now again, another some
mathematics. Do not bother about the figures. Just understand the principle
here. So, we are calling the termination of Kali-yuga as "K". So, 432.00 years
it is. So, Dwapar-yuga is twice. Treta-yuga is thrice. Satya-yuga is four times.
So, totally, one Mahayuga or divya-yuga becomes 10K. "K" is a plead of
Kali-yuga. And one Manvatara is 710K. You know, each one Manvantara is preceeded
and followed by a Sandhya Kaal. So, therefore, the duration of, the day of
Brahma is calculated to be 1000 Mahayaugas. Now, similarly, about one mate, one
day is 4.32 billion years. One day is 4.32 billions human years because day and
night are together. But they are continuous in that sense they are different.
They keep alternating. And one second is hundred thousand human years. So,
this is, this is how tiny our life is compared to the life of Brahma. So, this
is how the universe is fashioned.

You know, age of the Earth. So, we know that the lower planetary systems are
destroyed when they, so what this means is that since there are, how old is our
Earth? We have to look at six plus one Manvatara. Because there are seven
Manvataras. And there are seven Sandhyas which pass. That way, you can
calculate. And this, of the figure works out to be 1.972949108 billion years.
So, now, similarly, age of the universe, you can calculate out to be, and it
works out to be 155.521972949108 trillion years. So, this is the time duration.

Now, ultimately, all this is from different perspectives how different things
look. So, in one milli..., in millisecond of Brahman, actually our entire life
is coming and going. So, we can see different planets. And we can have different
sizes. And we can have different ideas of whether like maybe there or not. But
actually, our vision is so limited. We have to see through scriptural eyes, then
we will to see properly. So, most of you know the story. So, Bra..., Brahmaji, I
heard that your one second is our one thousand, one hundred thousand years. Yes.
So, and that your dollar is ours hundred thousand dollars. Yes. So, then he says
can I have your one dollar, please? So, what did Brahmaji say? One second, wait
a second my child. So, wait a second is wait for hundred thousand years. So,
actually speaking, life is s..., so small for us. We know about this.

Lomharsha Rishi, you know, he would have the benediction that his life, one hair
would fall in one Brahma's day and he will die when all of his hair had fallen.
And yet he would individually build a hat for himself. And when his disciple
wanted to beat, have a hat for him, he said, what is the use? I am going to die
so soon. What is the use of wearing a hat? So, you know, his life is so long.
But still, he also feels that his life is temporary. And he wants to live, he
wants to use all the time for self realisation. This how everything in this
world is temporary. No matter how much we try, we cannot change the essential
nature of this world. Now, so actually, our life is not very long. And the
earlier we recognise it, the better it is for us. So, it is said that life takes
off when we understand how soon life takes us off. So, life takes off, when we
understand how soon life takes us off. That, life takes us off means we are here
in the material world in a particular body, but we are not going to live here
for long. Life is going to take us off from this world to another world. And
when we understand, imagine if I have got a car, and with this car, say, I am in
Mumbai and I have to go to Pune. And I have been told that you will have the car
only for two and a half hours. And then I will have to drive very fast if I want
to reach Pune. And I am told if I am not able to reach Pune, then wherever I
have reached, I will have to drop the car over there. Then I have to find
another car, hire another car, and after that only, after I got adequate money.
Then I will be able to move forward by another car. So, then, what will I do?
Then, I will just move straightforward. I know that I will be taken out of this
car after the prescribed time, so let us, let me go as fast as possible so that
I can reach the destination as quickly as I can. But if it happens that I start
fooling around. I see this sight. I go to this hotel. I watch that movie. And
then what will happen? Even before I got to one, one tenth of the distance of
Puna, what, I will be lost in the sense that my car will be taken away. And
nothing will be left with me. So, therefore, what I have to do is, I have to
recognise that I have less time. And therefore, let me drive as fast as
possible. Similarly, in our spiritual life, life takes off when we understand
how soon life takes us off. Takes us off. So, we will be taken off by life from
this car of the body and put in another body. So, recognising the temporary
nature helps us to fix our minds on the eternal. Whatever be our ashram.
Whatever be our situation.

So, now, main part of this verse is that a devotee transcends death. Now, we may
wonder what exactly does it mean for a devotee transcend death. Is it something
that can be logically understood? So, we will discuss it in these three with
phases. Past, present and future. So, we will discuss the reactions that
materialistic people have. And how the reaction of devotees is different. So,
what is the example that Srila Prabhupada would often give for the difference
between the death of a devotee and the death of a materialist? His favorite
example was of akhya, of a kitten. When a cat holds a kitten. When a c..., when
a, say, his example would be that, actually speaking, when a per..., two people
may be held. But one is held by love. The other is held by, by the fear of
death. So, in both cases, the holding is there. But the purpose is very
different. And because the purpose very dest..., different, the destination also
is going to be very different. So, the c..., same cat might appear, but the cat
has a kitten in its mouth. And the cat has a rat in its mouth. So, both of them
feel entirely different. So, similarly, Prabhupada would say that for a devotee,
for a materialistic people, Krish..., person, Krishna comes as time. And for a
devotee, time comes as Krishna. That means time reveals himself as Krishna. So,
what does it mean time reveals himself as Krishna? That means a devotee is able
to return to Krishna through time. And that is how a devotee is satisfied. So,
now, it may happen that a devotee may also feel fearful. How does it happen that
actually I have become detachment, I have developed detachment. So, we have to
understand that what "utsahan", "niscayad", and "dhairyat" means. So, "utsahan
niscayad dhairyat" will be discussed later in more detail.

But here, let us focus on how we can beyond the trauma of death through God
consciousness. So, death is something that happens to the body. And as long as
the soul is attached to the body, the soul has to suffer the trauma of death.
Let us see, now, we know that, the Garuda Purana says that when a person dies,
that person gets chunk, chunk, chunk, what, if the pain is like forty thousand
scorpion bites. Now, when the scriptures give this kind of figures, we have to
understand they illus..., they are meant to illustrate a particular point. Now,
one scorpion bite is so stinging. It can be poisonous. It can be extremely
painful. So, forty thousand scorpion bites is immensely, intolerably,
frightingly fearful. So, this way, by understan..., by giving a quantification
like this, we are impelled. And who wants to in the world? Not sure, I know.
So, now, is it precise that everybody let it fa..., has exactly face forty
thousand scorpion bites pain? No, it depends on the person who is attached, and
how attached that person is to the body. But everybody will have to face the
trauma of death. And this trauma is not at all pleasant to face. 32:02
