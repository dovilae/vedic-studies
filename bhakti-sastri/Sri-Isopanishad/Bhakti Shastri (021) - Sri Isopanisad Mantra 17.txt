Hare Krishna.

Today, we start with the penultimate verse of the Isopanisad. It is mantra
seventeen. It is the last section in which prayers are being offered to the
Supreme Absolute Truth, the Isa about whom this Isopanisad is for help in
passing through the perilous journey of life as we struggle to return back to
the Supreme Lord. So, here, the prayer becomes more intense. And the longing is
that this material world is filled with so much danger. So, let me just end my
life and let me return back to you. So, let us, it, look at the mantra. And then
we will look at the purport.

    vāyur anilam amṛtam
    athedaṁ bhasmāntaṁ śarīram
    oṁ krato smara kṛtaṁ smara
    krato smara kṛtaṁ smara

So, "vāyur anilam amṛtam". So, there is air in the body. Let the life air mix
into the total reservoir of air. And "bhasmāntaṁ śarīram". So, let this body
die. Let the corpse get burnt. And at that time, "oṁ", O Absolute Truth, "krato
smara kṛtaṁ smara". Please remember what I have done for you. "krato smara kṛtaṁ
smara". Please remember. It is a repetit..., repetition. So, "krato" is,
"kratoho" is one of the words used to describe Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. So,
"krato" is for whom things are done. Prabhupada translates as supreme
beneficiary. So, "kṛtaṁ " is that which is done by me. So, "oṁ krato smara kṛtaṁ
smara". O Lord, for whom there are so many things have been done. Please
remember what has been done. So, let this, the, the translation is:

"Let this temporary body be burnt to ashes, and let the air of life be merged
with the totality of air. Now, O my Lord, please remember all my sacrifices, and
because You are the ultimate beneficiary, please remember all that I have done
for You."

Now, two distinct thoughts may strike us when we look at a mantra like this.
Firstly, it is a very intense sort of emotion that when we are going to die and
we see that death is going to come, at that time, what happens? At that time,
there is a desperate longing. Let the body fall. So, religion and spirituality
are not just causal pursuits as social cosmetics in our public life. No. People
want to look good. And that is fine. I have a car. I have a house. I have a dog.
I have a guru also. And I go to the temple also. They are not casual pursuits.
Actually, they are going to be of supreme importance in determining our
postmortem destiny. What will happen to us after death will be determined by how
we have related with God in this life, what we have done in this life. So, this
gravity comes out. When it is, let this body fall. Let everything end. Let me,
now, it is no explicit prayer. Let me return to you. But the mood here is what?
O Lord, I want to come back to you. And I hope, and I pray to you that reme...,
you remember what I have done for you. Srila Prabhupada will explain in the
purport the, and answer, elaboration that will address the second thought that
may come in our mind. You know, do we need to tell the Lord to remember? The,
the Lord already remembers. So, why do we need to tell the Lord to remember? So,
actually, this is, the acharyas described that the Upanishads do not necessarily
always talk at the pure devotional level. So, here, this full prayer is a
fervent call for mercy. You know, at the same time, it is not a call that is at
a pure devotional level. At a pure devotional level, we may just call out,
please my dear Lord, let me serve you. Come what may. As we see Vitara Svarup
praying. As we see, Kunti Maharani praying. Even dangers. So, you know, just
because this may not be a s..., a prayer the same level should, should not mean
that we look down at the prayer. The fact that a person is so soberly preparing
for death and thinking of death so gravely itself is instructive for us. We
rarely think about death with such seriousness. And even when we think about
death, often, our thoughts are fleeting. When we see some, death somewhere,
either in the society, or in the news, or more consequently when we see it in
our family, then we think about it for some time. But then life draws the wheels
of illusion around us. And we forget our mortality. So, the very fact that
someone is preparing for death and recognising that, what will happen to me
after death is not in my hands. It is in the hands of a Supreme Being on whom I
am dependent. So, naturally, what is praying, have mercy on me. So, here we can
focus more on the aspect of the gravity of the moment of death, and the
seriousness with which one has to prepare for it. And as a part of the
preparation, one is begging to the Lord, O Lord, please remember all that I have
done for you.

Let us look at Srila Prabhupada's purport. It has six sections in its. As we
said, discuss, these later purports become a little longer. So, first point is
Srila Prabhupada makes is the material body is a foreign dress. That must be
given up. This purport, what is it, mantra is talking about? About the give up
the body. So, Prabhupada says: why do you want to give up the body? Because the
body is foreign to the soul. Then, how, it, how should it be given up? Everybody
is going to die. But that is not enough. The best way to give up body is by
surrendering to the Lord, not by going to the brahmajyoti. So, all of us will
give up the body, we will get another body. The jnanis will go to brahmajyoti,
but the bhaktas alone will go back to Bhagavan. So, that is the best way to give
up the body. And now, if we want to give up the body, in that way, what is
required? What, it is, the last thought, that, what we think about at the time
of death will be of defining, decisive importance. Then, Srila Prabhupada
addresses the point that Krishna never forgets our service to Him. So, we may
not be able to remember at the time of death. But Krishna will remember our
service. And therefore, we should always service Him. And here, the prayer is
being offered to Lord to have mercy. But Krishna is always ready to g..., shower
His mercy on us. And Krishna's mercy is ever-available through devotional
service. And then what is that process of devotional service? So, this is a
devotional prayer. And Srila Prabhupada takes this opportunity to explain more
about devotion, and immediately connects it with Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam
elaborates this verse and all of the verses. And he talks about the various
exemplary characters from the Bhagavatam who are models of devotional service.
And then he says, prepare for death by devotional practice. So, we have to
practice in this life if we want to attain perfection at the end of our lives.

So, let us look at the first point. The material body is a foreign dre..., f...,
dress that must be given up. So, basically, people can have three distinct
attitudes towards the body. In Karma, in the path of karma, there is a path of
material enjoyment. One romanticises the body. In Jnana, one demonises the body.
And in Bhakti, one utilises the body. So, what does it mean to romanticise the
body? One thinks that the body is the source of great pleasure. And people dream
about their own body, how good-looking it is. And they t..., fantasize about
someone else's body. And they think that when two bodies will come together,
there will be so much pleasure. So, the idea is the body is a source of enormous
pleasure. And bodily serves pleasure is not just the greatest fantasy, but many
people think that it is the very purpose of existence. Krishna talks about this
mentality in the sixteenth chapter when he talks about the demoniac people. And
He tells that, what is their attitude? In 16.11, He says:

        kāmopabhoga-paramā
        etāvad iti niścitāḥ

Such people have, they feel that there is no doubt about this. The absolute
certainty is what? "kāmopabhoga-paramā", the supreme goal of life is sense
gratification. Srila Prabhupada translates this as:

"They have ascertained that the prime necessity of life is sense gratification."

If you let, nobody can live without this. And this is the purpose for which we
are all meant to live. So, in the path of karma, the body is romanticised as if
it is the ultimate goal of life, if to enjoy the body's pleasures. And the body
is like a wealth of pleasure, from which one just has to draw out and enjoy.
However, a little experience of life in the world also shows us that this is not
a realistic picture of bodily pleasure. The body's pleasure capacity is not like
that of a well, which has unending resource of water. The body's pleasure
goi..., capacity is more like a sponge that is filled with water. You know,
sponge is pressed, water comes out. Initally, just little touch and water comes
out. After that, we may press it, water comes out. After that, we squeeze it,
water comes out. And after some time, we squeeze it, squeeze it, and then all
that we get is the pain of pressing the sponge, and no water comes out. So, like
that, the body's capacity to enjoy is limited. And it is permanently,
irreversibly, unchangebly limited. So, therefore, we cannot, although we may in
our fantasies romanticise the body, we cannot actually live that fantasy.
Because the body's capacity is limited. And the body appears to be like a road
to pleasure. But the very road turns into a road block. So, imagine this
picture, if I am going along a road, and sometimes, some road block comes along.
That some trees have fallen. Or some other vehicle has fallen. So that they
breeze there. Then, we can remove the road block. But imagine the road itself
turns into a road block. Then, there is nowhere a person can go. So, body is
like a road to pleasure, that turns into a road block to pleasure. And no, we
cannot do anything about it. No matter, what we try. So, then, if a person, you
know, becomes somewhat philosophically astute. Then, the person understands that
actually the body is a trap. And all the senses that are there in the body, they
are going to drag us down. They are going to drag us down to sin. They are going
to drag us down to suffering. And this body is what makes us forgetful of our
true spiritual identity. And not only does it make it forgetful of our true
spiritual identity, but it makes us also a..., filled with sin, materialistic
desires that perpetuate our illusion. So, it is one thing to be blind. And it is
quite another thing to be blind about our blindness. That means if I do not have
eyes, then, at least, I know that I am blind. And then I am, when I am walk
carefully with a stake, or may ask somebody else please show me the way. But if
I am blind and not even aware that I am blind. Then, I just walk along and bang,
I may hit into a wall. And I may k...  break my noise, crack my head. So,
actually, the body makes us blind. It makes us forgetful of our spiritual
identity. But it makes us forgetful about our forgetfulness also. That it makes
us forget that we have forgotten our spiritual identity. It makes us think that
I am the body. And it, as if, and makes us think that bodily existence is
normal. And therefore, it is a trap. So, that is why Bhaktivinoda Thakur says,
"śarīra abidyā-jāl", it is not only avidya. It not only puts us in ignorance.
But it traps us in ignorance. It, it is a trap, jail. It is a net. So, what is
the cords of the net that drags us deeper and deeper? That is the bodily
desires.

So, in the path of Jnana, the body is demonised. What is this body that you are
attracted to? It is filled with stool and urine, and this, and that. And what is
the attraction to the body? So, cannot you see?

So, the Aila-gita, in the Eleventh Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Aila-gita is the
song 13:22
