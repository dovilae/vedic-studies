Introduction

1. What is the meaning of the word veda?

1. So the word Veda, Srila Prabhupada uses in his purport in the most expansive sense. He uses it to refer to all knowledge. So, the word Veda literally means knowledge. So, in fact, all knowledge that anybody has can be accepted as Veda. So in the expansive sense of the word, it refers to all knowledge.

2. And in average sense of the word, we use Vedic and non-Vedic. So, for example, we may say Islam, Christianity are non-Vedic religions because they do not accept the authority of the Vedas. So in the average sense, we refer to the Vedas as the Vedic literature.

3. And then there are some scholars who use the term Veda in a very restrictive narrow sense and they say, Veda refers to only the four Vedas. So they consider even the Smritis, the Puranas, Itihasas to be non-Vedic. So, that is the use of the word Veda in a very restrictive sense.

So the term can be used in broad senses. In general, Srila Prabhupada uses it Veda in the average sense to refer to the Vedic literature. Here, he uses it to refer to the Vedic, Vedas referring to all knowledge.
