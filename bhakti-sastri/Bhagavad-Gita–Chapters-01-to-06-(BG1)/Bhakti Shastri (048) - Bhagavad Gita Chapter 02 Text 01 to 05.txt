Hare Krishna. Welcome to the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter Two. So, at the end of the
Chapter One, Arjuna has put aside his bow.

        visṛjya sa-śaraṁ cāpaṁ
        śoka-saṁvigna-mānasaḥ

He is holding his head in his hands. His head is lowered. And his
"śoka-saṁvigna". His mind is filled with misery. "mānasaḥ". "śoka-saṁvigna",
with moroseness, with lamentation. And he has told through his actions to
Krishna that I will not fight. So, that is the end of the Arjuna Vishada Yoga.
Now, the second chapter starts. The second chapter has been named differently by
different acharyas. Sankhya Yoga is one of the standard names. Because sankhya
is what is talked about, at least in the initial parts of the chapter. And
sankhya essentially un..., involves analysis, analysis of existence into various
elements. So, the analysis of the existence into, basically, matter and spirit,
into our life, into body and soul, our being into material and spiritual sides.
So, Bhaktivinoda Thakur has said that the second Chapter has the whole Gita in
nutshell. And that is why he uses the name "Contents of the Gītā Summarized".
So, Prabhupada uses that name for the second chapter.

Let us look at the overview of second chapter. And then, we will move forward.
So, the sections can be divided into five. The first section is "Arjuna's
further doubts and surrender". So, Arjuna, you know, expresses one more reason.
That is indecision. And if we l..., because, you know, I am undecided. So, let
me just not take the more aggressive course of action. Let me not fight. Then,
Ar..., when Krishna, Krishna, He is basically using various reasonings to Arjuna
for fighting. So, first is, in 11 to 30, he says jnana. What is "jnana"?
It is Knowledge. Fight. So, using jnana, fight. As the soul is eternal,
compassion for the temporary body is ignorant and useless. So, here, He cou...,
counters Arjuna's compassion argument. First argument was, oh, how can I kill my
relatives? He felt compassionate for them. Second argument was, based on
enjoyment. So, in 31 to 38, is karma-kanda. So, that is the first application of
atma-jnana. Atma-jnana is I am not the body. I am the soul. So, when we
understand that you are not the body. You are the soul. That means you will
continue to live after you die, also. And if you act according to dharma, then
you will get elevated destination, go to svarga. By doing your prescribed
duties, you will enjoy. So, dharma has to be done to get kama and artha. So,
therefore, he says that, you sh..., if you want to enjoy also, only by doing
dharma, you will enjoy. And in this way, He counters Arjuna's enjoyment
argument. And then, further, there is a third argument, is about Nishkama Karma
yoga. Thi..., in the Nishkama Karma yoga argument, Krishna basically focuses on
Arjuna's concern that there will be suffering because Arjuna will be subjected
to sinful reactions. So, Krishna tells him that if you act in Nishkama Karma
yoga, then you will be doing activity which will bring no reaction. And when
there is no reaction, then there is no sinful reaction also. So, that is the
la..., next part. So, in Nishkama Karma yoga, that is second application of
atma-jnana. It is one level higher. If you really understand you are the soul,
then the goal is not to go to svarga. The goal is to go beyond material
existence to eternal spiritual existence. And for that, you will be, be not
attached to anything material. So, fight with detachment, then there will be no
sinful reactions. So, this counters Arjuna's sinful reactions argument. And
then, when he is talking about a person who is detached from everything
material, for that, Arjuna asked, who is that kind of person? I want to know
more about that person. Then, Krishna gives the characteristics of that person.
And there, that is the last sections. Characteristics of a sthita-prajna. So,
basically, in this section, Arjuna's three arguments, compassion, enjoyment and
sinful reactions is in one way countered. Now, the arguments will, the argument
about "kula-kṣaye praṇaśyanti", that destruction of family tradition will, will
be countered in the Third Chapter. And Arjuna's next last, fifth argument is
indecision. Which he will make in this Chapter. That will be countered by the
end of the Bhagavad Gita when K..., Arjuna expresses his decision. He gives up
indecision, expresses decision. I will fight. So, let us look at the chapter
now. It starts with:

        sañjaya uvāca

        taṁ tathā kṛpayāviṣṭam
        aśru-pūrṇākulekṣaṇam
        viṣīdantam idaṁ vākyam
        uvāca madhusūdanaḥ

So, "taṁ tathā kṛpayāviṣṭam". "taṁ", unto that person. Who is that person? The
previous chapter ended with the description of Arjuna. Arjuna had set down. So,
th..., unto that "tathā kṛpayāviṣṭam". So, that Arjuna, who had thus set down
overcome by "kṛpayā", by weakness, weakness caused by compassion. So,
"aśru-pūrṇākulekṣaṇam". So, "īkṣaṇam" is eyes. "pūrṇā", "ākula", "aśru-pūrṇa",
full of tears. That means that was not just a few tears. But the tears were
filling the eyes, practically speaking. If you consider the eyes to be
container. This is, then, the container was overflowing. And the t..., t...,
tears were coming out. "visidantam idam vakyam". "visidantam" means, he was
lamenting at that time, these words. "uvaca madhusudanah". So, that Lord,
Madhusudanah, he spoke these words. So, now, Srila Prabhupada, because this is
sank..., sankhyeva chapter, where is a difference between the body and the soul.
So, Srila Prabhupada's, takes the focus in this chapter on the point that,
actually, bodily emotions are illusory. So, in the previous chapter, the focus
was on talking about Arjuna's qualities. And that is why Prabhupada said that,
he is, Arjuna has, he is, he is thoughtful. He is saintly. He does not want to
hurt others. In all these ways, he is talking about the good qualities of
Arjuna. But now, he is going to talk about the bodily conception. And Prabhupada
starts itself is with a very sutra-like statement.

"Material compassion, lamentation and tears are all signs of ignorance of the
real self. Compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization."

That is through distinctive points Prabhupada makes, wh..., which are related.
But they are substantially different also. First is, ignorance of the real self.
So, when we are ignorant, when there is material compassion. There is
lamentation and tears. So, which is wha..., is what, Arjuna has e..., ex...,
exhibited. The, where are these three words coming from? These are coming from
what is talked about in the verse. It is "kṛpayā", "kṛpayā", "parayāviṣṭam". That is
material compassion. Then, there is "viṣīdantam". That is lamentation. And
"aśru-pūrṇākulekṣaṇam". That is tears. So, these three are coming up. And
Prabhupada is saying, the, all this indicates the ignorance of the true self.
And if the true self is known. And if one wants to become compassionate. Now,
how is one going to become compassionate to the true self? By cultivating
self-realisation. By cultivating self-realisation. So, compassion for the
eternal soul is self-realisation. That means, actually, the, a person does not
have to be hard-hearted if the person wants to be spiritually knowledgeable. We
just have, we have to direct the soft-heartedness in the right avenue. So, when
we are ignorant. If somebody is coughing. And we think, oh, that person is
coughing. What should I do? The cough causes so much pain. So, if somebody says,
oh, that person is coughing. Just stuff the person's mouth with a hanky. Then,
he will not cough. Hell, that is, you may want the person not cough. But that is
ignorant. That is not going to solve the problem of coughing. Actually, we have
to take the person to a doctor, and then give the proper medicine, and the
coughing will stop. So, when we see somebody coughing, naturally we feel, we
s..., if somebody com..., coughing very badly, we feel compassion for that
person. But compassion is, we are directed in a intelligent, enl...,
knowledgeable way, not an ignorant way. So, same way, with respect to the
suffering of material existence. When we see death. When we see old age. When we
see destruction. We naturally feel bad about it. But we have to have it in a
direct, those resulting feelings of compassion properly. So, that is, actually,
the person is suffering. But that person is suffering because of bodily
misidentification. There may be some specific causes of suffering right now,
which do need to be dealt with. But beyond that, person is fundamentally
suffering because of ignorance of the soul. So, that ignorance has to be
countered. And the way, that ignorance is countered is by becoming
self-realised. So, that is why compassion for the self is self-realisation. For
the eternal soul is self-realisation. So, actually, when we are chanting Hare
Krishna, we are being compassionate. Compassionate to ourselves. Compassionate
to others. That is self-realisation. Now, Prabhupada, of course, uses the word
Madhusudan. And he says, Madhu..., here, Krishna, he says, Krishna is the killer
of demons. So, then, Arjun..., Sanjaya is indicating from these over more so,
then, that, this Lord, who killed the demon, will now kill the demon of doubt,
the ki..., demon of indecision, the demon of delusion that has overcome Arjuna.
So, that is indica..., s..., indication of this particular word. Now, after
describing this, now, Krishna, this is the, this is the first verse, full verse
that Krishna is speaking. He has spoken just "paśya". "pa...", paśya". "pārtha
paśyaitān". Just see. That was the only word that Ar..., Krishna spoke in the
earlier chapter. Now, he starts speaking.

        śrī-bhagavān uvāca

        kutas tvā kaśmalam idaṁ
        viṣame samupasthitam
        anārya-juṣṭam asvargyam
        akīrti-karam arjuna

So, Krishna is surprised over here. He says "kutas tvā". Where from? "tvā
kaśmalam idaṁ". That such contamination has come upon you. "kaśmalam" is
contamination. "viṣame samupasthitam". "viṣame", "viṣame" means at a critical
moment, critical moment, how have you become weak-minded? So, now,
"anārya-juṣṭam asvargyam". This does not befit you. "anārya-juṣṭam". You are a
glorious person. So, sometimes, you know, if there is a big sporting event. Say,
there is a world cup final. And the last ball is coming. And then, baller is
about to ball. And the baller starts trembling. How can I ball? What will happen
in this ball? The captain says, come on, you are made of better stuff. You
cannot lose your nerve like this. So, people who lose their nerve, they are
sometimes, they are called as chokers. You choke when the pressure comes up. The
pressure comes up, person should be able to take the pressure. That is maturity.
That is the person, who can choke, check, take the pressure is said to be cool.
But somebody who cannot take the preassure is said chokes. So, he gives ch...,
ch..., that person gets choked up. So, Krishna is telling Arjuna, do not, now,
do not be a choker like that. So, nobody likes the label of a choker. You know,
a, people feel that, when the pressure comes, I will be able to take that
pressure. So, Krishna is telling "anārya-juṣṭam asvargyam". "anārya", this,
"viṣame samupasthitam". This is the, so crisis moment. This is pressure moment.
And at that time, the real stuff should come out. You know, the real strong you
should come out. But what is this I am seeing? "anārya-juṣṭam", does not become
you. So, "kutas tvā". Where, from where has such a feeling come about? This is
unexpected for you. Now, the words have special significance over here.

        anārya-juṣṭam asvargyam
        akīrti-karam arjuna

So, He is saying that, this, this action is unbit..., unbefitting for you in
three ways. What are three ways? It is unbecoming for you as an "ārya". It is
unbecoming for you because asvargyam. It will not take you to auspicious
destination. And also, "akīrti-karam". Even in this world, it will make, not
bring you fame, but infamy. So, it does not befit who you are. It does not befit
what you will get in the future, next life. It does not befit what will get, you
will get in this life also. So, in every way, this action is unworthy of you.

Now, what is the word "ārya"? Now, we have a very positive connotation of the
word "ārya". Say, the word "ārya", there is a particular society, which is
called as Arya Samaj. And they have the idea that "āryan" is that particular
kind of people. Historically, it is said that "āryan" was a very advance race.
Srila Prabhupada acknowledges all this. But he says these are all external
meanings. The essential meaning of the word "ārya", when Krishna is using it, he
is not referring to it, oh, you do not, you do not belong to a particular race.
He says, Prabhupada says, "ārya" refers to those who know the purpose of life,
who know spiritual purpose of life, who have spiritual values. They are "ārya"s.
So, today, the word "ārya" has a very negative connotation in western thought as
well as the thought that has come to India, also. Basically, now, words acquire
certain meanings based on how they are used. And the word "ārya" has become
almost like a, in today's intellectual dialogue, discourse, it has become like
an untouchable word. Nobody wants to use that word to identify themselves. Just
like nobody wants to be called a fanatic, a religious fanatic. You know, that is
probably the worst label that a person can get today. You are white doing
extremist. So, like that, the word "ārya" has got a lot of negative connotation.
In fact, you know, the association with Vedic culture, there was this also, they
are the "swastika". So, there was an attempt in Germany to get the "swastika"
banned. Because "swastika" itself has associations which are very very
unpleasant memories for certain people. So, the word "ārya" has not been banned.
But it has also become like that. So, why is that? Prabhupada explains, beyond
any racial, cultural connotation, he says, the "ārya" has spiritual connotation,
spiritual meaning. That is, that it refers to the person who has spiritual
values. That person is "ārya". Now, words have two feature. There is
denotation. And there is connotation. Denotation means what the word directly
means. Connotation means what it implies. So, when we use words, we have to be
aware of both. For example, we had discussed earlier the word "gay". The word
"gay", denotation, in fifteen years ago, it was just simply the cheerful. But
now the word "gay" has a completely different meaning. So, like that, now, of
course, that words have certain meanings. And they have certain subtle
associations when the words are used. So, the word, what is the problem with the
word "ārya"? So, actually, when the Europeans came to India. They discovered
after Columbu..., a, after Vasco da Gama came to India. You know, basically,
the, Europe was divided into catholics and protestants. So, there were two main
divisions from the 15th, 16th century onwards between the church. And Spain,
Portugal, and Italy, these were the countries which were under the catholic
church. And France, Germany, you know, Britain, they were all under protestants.
So, they had their own churches, anglican church and other churches. But there
was a split. And both of them felt that we should evangelise the world.
Evangelise means we should spread the gospell of Christianity everywhere. So,
the protestants went to America. Amerigo Vespucci and Columbus went there. Then,
Vasco da Gama came to India. Now, when, of course, primary, Italy and Spain,
they were under catholics. So, then, after that, so, they, they went to South
America. And then, there was, the, the catholics and protestants, war was going on
in Europe. And similarly, in ..., wars were going on. But eventually, Britain,
which was a proper western country, it got paramount seed. It got power over
India. And then, when they came to India, initially, they found it, oh, this
culture is so majestic. Such a cul..., you know, there is, so ad..., first
thought, e..., everybody apart from Christians must be very bad barrack people.

And Rudyard Kipling even wrote a poem. His poem was that, it is the white men's
burden to civilise the rest of socie..., rest of the world. So, he says, just
like, it is a father, fa..., it is a father's responsibility to grow the child,
to educate the child. So, he said that, the whole rest of the world is
uncivilised. It is primitive. It is uncultured. And it is the white men's burden
to civilise the rest of society, rest of the world. So, they had their own
superiority complexes, complex. That we are best in the world. And, of course,
they had science and technology which added to that infatuation. So, when they
came to India, they were shocked to see that India had its own magnificent
literature and a lofty vision of history which spanned far, far greater than
their history. For, you know, all the doors of history ultimately go to
Greece. You know, there is Aristo..., there is Pl..., Socrates, Plato,
Aristotle. And something beyond that, but primarily, Greek civilisation was
considered to be very advanced. And after that, Jesus came. And Jesus redeemed
everything. So, that was the idea. But the Vedic civilisation went thousands and
thousands of years beyond. And initially, they thought, this was a very primitive
civilisation. But the, as some of them started, to, looking at the sanskrit
literature. They saw the scope of it. They were stunned. And somehow, their
superiority complex could not digest the idea that the, there can be any
civilisation which is more advanced than our civilisation. So, then, they tried
to come up with various ideas, how, how how can we do, accept this. You know.
Then, basically, they found that there was a lot of similarity also. For
example, the Monier-Williams, and Max Muller, and all these other prominent
indologists. That means western European scholars, who studied India. The branch
of knowledge which studied India is called as indology. So, of course, it
involves philosophy. It can involve language. It can involve religious studies.
It can involve anthropology. Various fields can be there in that. But the broad
branch is called as indology. So, now, these, all these people when they
studied, they found that sanskrit was remarkably similar to Latin and Greece.
But not only was it similar, it was actually better. Sanskrit was more refined.
The vocabulary was better. And the structure, with the grammar structure, and
the aesthetic was also better. So, the grammar is for techniques. And we have
figures of speech. We have metaphor, literal devices. That is for aesthetic. So,
the techniques and aesthetics, b..., of sanskrit, both were superior to Latin
and Greek. And, now this was even more difficult for them to digest. So, then, a
logical inference, if, it, both are su..., if sanskrit is superior to both, and
one inference could be that, why is there similarity there? Because they are all
related. And sanskrit is superior. Because sanskrit is more advanced. And then,
probably, there was some old civilisation from which they were offshoots. And
that, s..., so, some offshots went to Europe. And that is how European
civilisation came about. But this was unacceptable to their superiority complex.
You know, that means these barbarians. So, they had the idea we are civilised
people. Rest of the world is barbarians. So, these barbarians, they are our
source. And they have a civilisation better than us. That they just could not
accept. So, they came up with their own theory. That, ok, the European
civilisation and the Indian civilisation. Both have involved from some other
civilisation.

And that civilisation, they called as aryan civilisation. And they had the idea
aryans came from somewhere. They came in civilise Europe. And they came in
civilise India, also. Now, this was not just to explain a way, the magnificence
of Indian culture. That was one aspect. But there was a political impo...,
po..., it was not just for justify their superiority. There was a political
agenda behind this also. See, when the muslims came and ruled India. The muslims
came and started staying in India. So, numerous muslims came and stayed in India.
And lot of muslims, Indians also got converted, also. But anyway, the muslims,
when they came, you know, for example, Akbar Babar, their, their intention
was to rule. They stayed in India. Akbar Babar, from Babar onwards, they were,
they, India became their home. But for the Britishers, you know, the, India was
like a degraded land. And for most Britishers, they felt that, going to India is
like a punishment. You know, for some officer is posted in India. It is, India
is such a primitive, dirty, uncultured place to be posted. There is like a
punishment. So, they did not want to stay there. But at the same time, they
wanted to mo..., maintain their rule here. So, they decided, the only way we can
rule India, if Indians consider, if India is, do not cooperate with our rule, we
will not be able to rule them. So, the only way we can rule India is, if Indians
voluntarily accept that we are superior to them. That we are superior to them.
And that, we will teach them, and we are there for their help, not to rule them,
but to help them. Then, they will accept our rule. So, then, how do you make
Indians accept their rule? So, from the Indian point of view, you know, from
the, if Indians are going to study the, look at them from the Vedic sper...,
scriptural point of view. And people who eat meat, people who drink alcohol,
people who are not following on the basic regulative principles of life,
regulative principles. No, they are considered low-class. So, how can they be
respected? So, of course, they had the power of science and technology which
brought some respect. And they were political rulers, which also brought some
respect. But that respect was a grudging respect. That was not a willing
respect. So, then, they felt that the only way we can make them respect us is if
they see that our culture is superior to theirs. And if that is to be done, then
their framework for evaluating cultural superiority has to be changed. And for
that purpose, they decided, it was a, it was a huge program, which has gone on,
over multiple generations. They decided that, you know, people's faith, Indians'
faith in the Vedic literature has to be destroyed. When that faith has
destroyed, then they will not see us through the framework of those eyes,
through that scrip..., those cultural standards. And they will see our
superiority. So, when the muslims came to India, they destroyed temples. Many
temples, they have destroyed. Thousands in fact. But when the Britishers came to
India, they did not destroy so many temples. Their strategy was much deeper.
They destroyed the faith that made people go to the temples. By misinterpreting
the Vedic literature in a systematic way, they destroyed the faith. So, one of
the ideas was, that rather than acknowledging that, In..., Indian culture is,
Indian civi..., literature, Indian culture is superior to European culture, they
said that both of us, we have come from some other culture. And that they called
as aryan civilisation. So, in that sense, we are both long-lost brothers. You
know, our ancestors, the same. They are the ancient aryas. And we have both come
from same ancestors. And now, we, long-lost brothers have met. And now that we
have met, we will, we have learnt some things more. So, we will teach them to
you. So, and that, original aryan culture, that was lost. So, practically,
everything that was good about Indian culture, they said that, oh, that has not
come from India. That has come from that aryan civilisation. And the original
Indians, they were the dravidians. Dravidian, they were low-caste, low-cla...,
low-quality people. And, of course, this is a very complex social-political
issue. So, I will not go into the intricacies. Our focus here is on the current,
current untouchable status that was associated with the word "aryan". Why is
that?

So, what happened was that this, so, idea. So, his, his, Srila Prabhu..., one
of Srila Prabhupada's scholar disciple, Devamrita Maharaja has written a book
"Searching for Vedic India" where he talks extensively about this. And this is a
huge field of academic research, also. So, basically, when the idea came up that
there was an ancient civilisation which is the mother, which is the parent of
both the European civilisation, the Greco-Roman civilisation, and the Indian
civilisation. Then, the quest for that ancient motherland became frenetic. You
know, where was it? There, the problem is that if there was the ancient
civilisation. And that was so advanced that it led to the, all the good parts of
the Indian civilisation and all the good parts of European civilisation, also.
Then, it itself must have been very advanced. Where is that civilisation? And,
actually, archeology, and history, all around in the Eurasia, or for that
matter, in that whole area, we could not give any s..., tangible evidence for
an ancient, advanced civilisation anywhere else. So, now, the correct
understanding is that, actually, that ancient civilisation was in India itself.
And after the Kurukṣetra war, then people started, a, a, when the strong rule of
the, of it, Hastinapur over India, and the world started weaking, then there was
emigration. And then there was disconnection. And that is how the expatriates so
went from here everywhere else. So, but the point was that, actually, the ar...,
heart line of the aryan civilisation was India only. And aryans and dravidians,
they were living compatibly together for, and th..., this whole division is,
actually, quite artificial. There was so many races over there in India, at that
time, also. Different people were living reasonably harmoniously. But this idea
came up that aryans were staying somewhere else. And that way, you know, Indians
could be deprived of the credit for their advanced religion. Because, this,
your, this is not yours. This is the aryan civilisation, all the good parts.
Sanskrit has come from the aryans. Now, if these aryans were invading tribes,
who came. There are several problems with this. First is, there is no s...,
psychological evidence for any advanced civilisation in, anywhere in Eurasia.
Beyond that, if she did, the aryans were just nomadic tribes, that was the idea.
You know, they were tribes who were, nomadic means traveling here and there.
Now, these nomadic tribes sang the Rigveda. That is the idea. So, now, Rigveda
and Sanskrit itself, Rigveda itself is a complex poetry. And Sanskrit is such a
profound language that even the understanding the grammar of sanskrit takes
twelwe years. So, then, the question comes up, if there was a race which is
primarily nomadic, you know, people who were just traveling, how much time do
they have to study? If they do not even have one place to stay. Then, they are
always on the move. When can they study? And how much can they study? If we
look at the anthropology of the world. Anthropology is study of the cultures,
cultures of the world. Then, we see that, generally, nomadic people do not
develop much literature. Their language is not very sophisticated. Even their
thoughts, they may have wisdom because of traveling. But in terms of
literary sophistication and linguistic depth, that is not possible for nomadic
tribes. You know, you know, we have some idea of this. When a, when, say, some
preachers and some devotees are traveling a lot. Then, you may, can read a few
books while traveling. Because now traveling is easy. We can travel by cars. We
can travel by trains. We can travel by planes. But earlier, when people, who
traveled, you had to travel on horse pack. Or you had to walk. Or you had to
travel by some other animal drau..., drau..., using some other draught animals.
So, then, that sort of traveling is not very conducive for reading. So, then,
w..., and what about systematic serious study? So, there is a complete mismatch
between the idea that there i..., there is a, there is nomadic tribes who is
going from place to place, to place. And their writing, and speaking, and
singing in a language whose grammar takes twelwe years to master.

So, basically, the point is the aryan invasion theory or the aryan migration
theory, that is a complete speculation. You know, it is, it is a total mess. And
there is practically no evidence for it. But anyway, the idea was once this
ar..., once this claim of an ancient civilisation which populated the Euro...,
Europe, as well as populated and civilised both Europe and India came up, then
every c..., you know, almost every European country started claiming, oh, we are
that ancient European civilisation. We are that ancient civilisation. 29:09
