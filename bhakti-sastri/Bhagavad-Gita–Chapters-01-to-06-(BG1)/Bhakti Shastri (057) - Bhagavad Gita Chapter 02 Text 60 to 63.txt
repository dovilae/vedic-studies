Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita course. On the second chapter, we
are now moving to the end of the second answer and then to the third answer. Let
us start at once. So, second answer was, the four questions were. 
"sthita-prajñasya kā bhāṣā". "kiṁ prabhāṣeta". So, actually, "kā bhāṣā" and "kiṁ
prabhāṣeta", they are very related questions. So, "kā bhāṣā", the question is
answered in 55. Then, "kiṁ prabhāṣeta". What is his language? That is answered
in 56 and 57. So, actually, we are discussing third question now. That is
answered from 58 to 63. So, and then, after that, that was "kim āsīta". How does
that person control the senses? How does that person regulate the senses? And
then, "kim vrajeta" will be answered from 64 onwards. So, let us look at 59 now.
The, so, we discussed till 59, actually. So, let us start with 60 now.

        yatato hy api kaunteya
        puruṣasya vipaścitaḥ
        indriyāṇi pramāthīni
        haranti prasabhaṁ manaḥ

"yatato". "yatato" is to endeavor. "hy api kaunteya". So, oh, K..., oh,
kaunteya, oh, Arjuna, even when a pen..., person is endeavoring, certainly
endeavoring. "puruṣasya vipaścitaḥ". Which kind of person? "vipaścitaḥ". Person
who has discrimination. Who has the capacity to know what is right and what is
wrong. And even for such a person, "indriyāṇi pramāthīni". "pramātha" is like
madness, storm. So, "indriyāṇi pramāthīni", the wild and impetuous senses.
"haranti prasabhaṁ manaḥ". "haranti" means they drag away. They steal away.
"prasabhaṁ manaḥ". So, they drag away thoroughly by force, "prasabhaṁ manaḥ".
So, now, there are several important features of this verse. The, Krishna, here,
is not talking about or..., ordinary person who is controlled by the senses. So,
materialistic people think that the goal of their life is to enjoy their senses.
So, often, they let themselves be dragged by their senses. So, such people are,
who are interested in material sense gratification even if that material sense
gratification is by religious means. You know. Today, that means there are
vikarmis. There are karmis. And then, there are yogis. So, vikarmis are those
who chase after sense gratification, you know, and defy the principles of dharma
in the process. So, for example, say, people who have extramarital, premarital
relationships. And that sort of thing. Those people are vikarmis. Then, those
people, who are karmis, those are people who seek sense gratification, but by
religious means. So, Krishna has talked about them in the previous section in
2.42-43. He talks about the aspire for svarga. For what purpose? "kāmātmānaḥ
svarga-parā". And there, He has used for them the word "avipaścitaḥ".

        yām imāṁ puṣpitāṁ vācaṁ
        pravadanty avipaścitaḥ
        veda-vāda-ratāḥ pārtha
        nānyad astīti vādinaḥ

So, those people think that, they are attrac..., be attracted by the flowery
words of the Vedas. They think that the sense gratification promised in the
Vedas is the ul..., in, in svarga, is the ultimate goal of life. And "nānyad
astīti vādinaḥ". They say there is nothing else. So, such people are
"avipaścitaḥ". So, the "avipaścitaḥ" are the people who do not understand that
there is a higher goal of life beyond sense gratification. That that sense
gratification ultimately comes, keeps one in bodily consciousness. And the
higher happiness is available by raising to spiritual consciousness. So, these
are "avipaścitaḥ". People are the karmis. Now, higher than them are the yogis.
The yogis are "vipaścitaḥ". They understand that material enjoyment leads to
suffering, leads to bondage. It perpetuates illusion. Therefore, I must break
free from it. You know, so su..., even such people, Krishna is saying, those who
are "vipaścitaḥ". Those who have discrimination. Those who can understand the
difference between matter and spirit. And based on that differentiation, they
try to pursue, you know, spiritual reality. Spiritu..., self-realisation. So,
even such people, so, they, e..., they have vision. They have discrimination.
And then "yatato". They are also striving. That means there are these two
aspects. There is "vipaścitaḥ". Internally, they have discrimination. And
internally, they also have it, they, they have that endeavoring. They are
trying to endeavor. But even such people, what happens to them? "haranti
prasabhaṁ manaḥ". What are they trying to do? They are trying to control their
senses. Sorry. They are trying to control themselves. But the senses are so
wild. Their senses drag away the mind. Now, it is interesting. Krishna is saying
senses drag away the mind. So, let us try to understand this point now. So,
first point is that these are not ordinary materialists Krishna is talking
about. They are not vikarmis. They are not karmis. They are yogis. Those who are
"vipaścitaḥ". And those who are "yatato". So, they have knowledge. And they are
striving to live according to knowledge. Even they are dragged away. So, most of
us, you know, fall in this category. Or actually, this category of people being
dragged away by the senses may be a little higher than what we are, also. You
know, we, often, pursue senses gratification, also, by, within, you know, the
precincts of dharma. You know, but here, K..., somebody is trying to break free
from sense gratification. What about such a person? Krishna says over here that
such a person. The s..., the, so, there is a hierarchy. There are the senses.
There are the sense objects. So, ok, ok, the sense objects are here. The senses
are here. And the mind is here. So, we, you know, connect with the sense objects
through the senses. You know, for example, that the eyes see some beautiful
form. The, you know, a, tongue wants to taste some deli..., delicious food item.
So, senses come in contact with sense objects. Now, the senses are internally
connected with the mind. In fact, the mind is a center of all the senses.

        śrotraṁ cakṣuḥ sparśanaṁ ca
        rasanaṁ ghrāṇam eva ca
        adhiṣṭhāya manaś cāyaṁ
        viṣayān upasevate

So, Krishna describes in 15.9 that the five senses, "śrotram", "cakṣuḥ",
"sparśa", "rasa", and "ghrāṇam". So, the ears, the, the sensation of s...,
sight, then touch, fragrance, smell, and taste. All these are centered around
the mind, just as, we could say that the five fingers are centered around the
palm. So, now, the senses are internally connected to the mind. And Krishna is
saying, so, if you consider this hierarchy, there are the sen..., ok, the sense
objects are here, outside. The senses are here. And the mind is inside. So, the
senses drag away the mind. That means the mind is, when we expose ourselves
externally to sense objects, then, the desires that are created by that, so
that, by that cr..., perception of the sense objects. By that, the mind is
forcefully drawn towards that. And when the mind is drawn towards that, then,
you know, our desires get further ignited, fueled. They become inflamed. And
then, we, just like, a motor, drawn towards fire, we are drawn towards the sense
objects. So, here, Krishna is giving a warning about if one just simply b...,
if, now, the, the 58 verse, He said that, one should withdraw the senses, just
like a, a tortoise withdraws the limbs. But here, Krishna is saying that, if one
f..., one is striving to do that. But somehow, if one, you know, the senses are
so powerful, that when senses perceive the sense objects, now, tuck. The senses
drag the mind outwards. "haranti prasabhaṁ manaḥ". So, this is quite a sobering
verse to contemplate. Such is the power of the senses. That even when we want to
control, still, we are dragged away. And we have all experienced this as we
tri..., strive for sense control. We find our senses just dragging us,
forcefully, desperately. Often, they make seem, they make us helpless entirely.
So, Prabhupada gives in these purports the example of Viswamitra muni. You know,
he was a, in the forest, and trying to pros..., pro..., practice austerity. But
when he heard the ankle bells of Menaka. Then, just that thought agitated him.
And then, he just forgot everything else. And he got attracted. Now, we may
think, how is this? If somebody has renounced the world, somebody is pros...,
pro..., practicing austerity, how is it that just the, you know, the jingling of
some ankle bells can cause a person to get just dragged down like this? So,
actually it is not just jingling of the ankle bells. That is just a sound. But
that sound, when it enters the mind, it kindles the imagination. So, now, when
the mag..., imagination is triggered, it bursts forth. And then, when the
imagination bursts forth upwards, it just fills us with fantasies of pleasure.
And then, we are dragged away. So, often, this principle of sense control is
talked from the male perspective. That you know a male should not be attracted
to the female. But actually, the Bhagavatam also talks from the female
perspetive, also. You know that, a woman who is too attracted to a man. Then, it
is like, the woman is like a deer. And the man is like the hunter. Woman will be
shot. So, by, the deer. So, there are examples from both perspectives. Most of
the time, the scriptures, you know, talk from the male perspective. Because the
male body is considered to be more suitable for self-realisation. That is why we
have examples of, say, Viswamitra muni and Menaka. But in general, the principle
is that, you know, for a, even we see such things, we have to understand that
there is generic description about sense objects over here. So, what will be
sense objects, for males and females will be different. You know, but in
general, you know, the principle is that the sense objects will drag us down.
So, "haranti prasabhaṁ manaḥ". Forcefully dragged the mind away. Then, after
describing this, then, Krishna, you know, when, now, Prabhupada, in this
purport, talks about, Prabhupada continues the, you know, process of Krishna
Conscious description. For what purpose?

You know, Srila Prabhupada is continuing from the previous verse, where he
talked about "paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate". That getting a higher taste. What is that
higher taste? Prabhupada continues that flow of thought in his purport. And he
gives an example how a devotee, an exalted can give such a higher taste that
everything else becomes forgotten. So, he quotes Yāmunācārya. This is a, this is
a well-known verse which Srila Prabhupada would often quote.

        yad-avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-pādāravinde
        nava-nava-rasa-dhāmany udyataṁ rantum āsīt
        tad-avadhi bata nārī-saṅgame smaryamāne
        bhavati mukha-vikāraḥ suṣṭhu niṣṭhīvanaṁ ca

So, he is saying that from the time I have started relishing the joy of Krishna
Consciousness. So, "yad-avadhi". From that time. "mama cetaḥ". My consciousness.
"kṛṣṇa-pādāravinde". The lotus feet of Lord Krishna. When I remember it. What
happens? "nava-nava-rasa-dhāmany" I get new, new rasas. New, new mellows in
that. "udyataṁ rantum āsīt". So, "rantum". I am enjoying, relishing that.
"tad-avadhi". From that time onwards. "tad-avadhi bata nārī-saṅgame smaryamāne".
When I think of sex pleasure. "bhavati mukha-vikāraḥ". My mouth becomes twisted.
Say, generally, when we see something, which is very displeasing, very
irritating, even disgusting. Then, "mukha-vikāraḥ". The mouth becomes twisted.
"suṣṭhu niṣṭhīvanaṁ ca". And I spit it, the thought. So, there are several
important points in this verse. First of all, from the point of view of material
sense gratifiers, it is very jolty. You know, that which most people in the
world are dreaming and fantasising about. Somebody says I spit at it. It is very
jolting for people. How is this possible? What is this being talked about over
here? So, this indicates that the pleasure of Krishna Consciousness is so lofty
that as compared to that, everything else seems trivial, insignificant. And now,
even if that is such a higher pleasure, and this is such a, it is a, even
if the pleasure, this is a lower pleasure, why would one be disgusted at it? Why
would one the, why would, why is dis..., what is the reason for disgust and
spitting at it? Actually, for a devotee, anything that distracts one from
Krishna, is actually a, a source of, is, a source of danger, a source of
distress, a source of dismay. So, when a devotee thinks, oh, for so long, for
such a trivial pleasure, I have let myself become distracted from Krishna. So,
that is how the devotee feels revolted by that. And that is how the devotee
turns away from it. Now, another significant point in this verse is that,
Yāmunācārya says that, actually, since the time I started relishing the thoughts
of Krishna, since that time, when the "nārī-saṅgame smaryamāne". That when I get
the thought of sex pleasure. I, it is now, it is interesting that even when one
is relishing the joy of Krishna Consciousness, even at that time, one may get
the thought of sex pleasure. So, it is not that we should not mistake that just
because I am getting bad thoughts, that means I have to fall down. Actually,
because of the world that we live in. And, now Yāmunācārya was living thou...,
nearly a thousand years ago. So, at that time, the culture was much much purer.
But now, there is so much impurity. But even at that time, because we are living
in the material world, we may get exposed to things. You know, which provoke us.
Which inject thoughts of, you know, sensuality within us. And even from our own
past memories, sometimes, something may just come up. So, sometimes, when we
just get some bad thoughts. We start thinking, oh, I am so fallen. You know,
these bad thoughts are coming. What should I do? I have to succumb to them. No.
We do not have to. Actually, the, we see such a radical difference here. That
when the thoughts come in, nothing doing. So, that nothing doing is f..., is
spoken in the most assertive, forceful way by saying I spit at that. "bhavati
mukha-vikāraḥ suṣṭhu niṣṭhīvanaṁ ca". So, what changes between an advanced
devotee and a new devotee, is that, not necessarily that there will be no impure
thoughts coming. Impure thoughts may come. You know, but the advanced devotee's
response to those thoughts is radically different from that of the neophyte
devotee. You know, the sa..., struggling sadhaka, initial stages. So, generally
speaking, what happens is, you know, the serious devotee, when the thought
comes, he says, no, get lost. The materialistic person, when the thought comes,
welcome. I was just waiting for you. So, welcome. Welcome. So, yes. Yes.
Welcome. So, now, these are two extremes. The pure devotee and the materialist.
Now, sadhaka is somewhere in-between. Sometimes, the sadhaka says yes. Come.
Sometimes says no. No. And most of the time, sadhaka says wait. Wait. Not now.
Maybe later, we will see. When nobody is around. When nobody will find out what
I am doing. Then, we will see. So, that is how it happens. So, now, if we see,
everybody. So, there is a pure devotee here. There is the materialist here.
And the sadhaka, who is moving from material life towards pu..., towards
devotion, and ultimately pure devotion. So, now, the essential difference is,
both are exposed to the temptations. Of course, the materialist may be exposed
to temptations much much more. Because they are, they, that is what they want to
do. And that is why they search out temptations. The pure devotee avoids as much
as possible. But still, being in the material world, we will be, all be exposed
to temptations. So, the difference is, here, there is welcome. Here, there is
nothing doing. So, we have to make this journey from welcome to nothing doing.
So, essentially, even if we get wrong thoughts, that does not mean that we have
to fall down. What we have to do is, we have to drive out those wrong thoughts.
And how do we drive them out? By filling the mind with Krishna. When the mind
becomes filled with Krishna. Then, we become, you know, i..., the i..., immoral
thoughts, the sensual thoughts, they do not get any time over there. They are
driven away. They are driven out from the consciousness.

So, in this way, actually, a devotee moves from this stage of materialism to
the stage of pure devotion. It is a long journey. But it is not an impossible
journey. Every time, when the temptation comes and we says no. We say no to it.
We are growing stronger. We are moving upwards. And we are coming closer and
closer to Krishna each time. We turn away from the temptations. And we turn
towards Krishna. So, Prabhupada, you know, gives us the example of, there is a
lec..., le..., letter of Prabhupada, where he says, to get thoughts is not
wrong. But to act on the thoughts, that is wrong. And there, Prabhupada gives a
very striking definition of intelligence in that letter. He says, intelligence
means to kill the thoughts before they grow into actions. Intelligence means to
kill the thoughts before they grow into action. So, thoughts will come. So, we
will see in the next verse how thoughts can grow into, grow to disastrous
proportions if we are not careful about them. But essentially, if we do not let
the thoughts grow into actions. Then, the problem is far far lesser. So, that is
how we can move forward in our spiritual life. Now, Prabhupada explains in the
furpo..., purport. If, for the example of higher taste, what does he say here?
That:

"It is as if a hungry man had satisﬁed his hunger by a sufﬁcient quantity of
nutritious eatables."

So, you know, in the previous verse, the word was "nirāhārasya". One feels as if
I do not have any "āhār". But when we turn towards Krishna and fix our mind on
Krishna, then we get such a deeper, inner, richer happiness. That we feel, yes.
I got this. I do not need anything else. I am satisfied.

	bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir
	anyatra ca ...

The Bhagavatam says that, bhakti, when there is exp..., wh..., when, when
practices bhakti. Then, bhakti leads to the "pareśānubhavo", the experience of
the Supreme Lord. When that experience of the Supreme Lord is there,
"pareśānubhavo", then, there is "viraktir  anyatra ca", one becomes detached
from other external things. One does not feel the need for anything else.
Because one gets a deeper, richer, inner happiness. "viraktir  anyatra ca". So,
this is what a, you know, this is what Yāmunācārya is experiencing. And then,
Srila Prabhupada quotes Mahārāja Ambarīṣa here. And actually, Srila Prabhupada
just continues talking in his purports. So, in a sense, Prabhupada refers to
certain things in the verses. But Prabhupada is more concerned about telling us
how to apply those verses in our life. And, therefore, his purport just
continues. So, he has mentioned Ambarīṣa Mahārāja in this verse. And he will
ex..., elaborate on Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, his pastime in the next verse. So, now,
let us look at the next verse. So, now, a Kr..., here, this is the last part of
the, so, now, Krishna will describe, how a person may practice spiritual life.
How can one get the higher taste? So, till now, he has said that we should all
seek the higher taste. So, how does one get the higher taste? That we will
describe in the next verse.

        tāni sarvāṇi saṁyamya
        yukta āsīta mat-paraḥ
        vaśe hi yasyendriyāṇi
        tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā

So, "tāni sarvāṇi saṁyamya". So, "tāni sarvāṇi". All these senses, "saṁyamya".
Controlling. "yukta āsīta mat-paraḥ". When one with this situates oneself. In
other word, "āsīta" is related to the question. "kim āsīta". That was there in
2.54. So, Krishna has said "yukta āsīta". So, when one engages the senses and
situates oneself of, thus. How does one engage the senses? "mat-paraḥ". Fixing
the mind on me. In the first place in the Bhagavad Gita, that Krishna is
referring to Himself. "mat-paraḥ". "mat-paraḥ". Krishna is saying over here that
fix the mind on me. Krish..., there is this, the first, the acharyas, who say,
this is the first drop of bhakti that Krishna has dropped in the Bhagavad Gita
till now. So, till now, Krishna has not referred to Himself directly. And even
He, till now, Krishna has been the teacher of sense control. That yes. We all
have to control our senses. But from here onwards, Krishna starts saying I am
the object of the controlled senses. I am the object on which the controlled
senses should be fixed. "tāni sarvāṇi saṁyamya". Control all those senses.
"yukta āsīta mat-paraḥ". And then, you know, in, big, situated, thus, fix the
sense, fix "yukta āsīta mat-paraḥ". Fix the consciousness on me. When you do
this, "vaśe hi yasyendriyāṇi". Then, you will be able to bring the con...,
senses under your conquest. "yasyendriyāṇi". Such a person who can do it, it,
"tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā". So, in a sense, this verse is talking about three
stages. "tāni sarvāṇi saṁyamya". So, "saṁyamya" means actually sort of restraint
or control. Now, when we need to control or restrain, when there is some
opposition force which prevents us from controlling, which is, which is opposing
us. That is why, you know, we need to control. So, at the, at this f..., Krishna
is talking here about the stage of struggle. In that stage of struggle, we have
to have some level of ba..., control. "tāni sarvāṇi saṁyamya". And that alone is
not enough. After that, "yukta āsīta mat-paraḥ". One, after that, fixes the
consciousness on Krishna. And when one fixes the consciousness on Krishna, then
after that, "vaśe hi yasyendriyāṇi". One, after that, conquers the senses. So,
first, there is control. Then, there is concentration. And then, there is
conquest. So, control. Control is what? Control the senses. Just like when you
are practicing devotional service. When we want to say, we have to have some
basic level of co..., self-control. So, then, we start practicing. If you want
to chant Hare Krishna. If you want to go to a temple. Then, if, even in the
temple, our eyes are running here and there. Who has come? How are they dressed?
What are they doing? Then, where can we, how can we experience anything
spiritual in the temple? Even the temple, we will be just staying in bodily
consciousness. Looking at how, who is dressed? And who, what, o..., how one
looks? And what one is doing? So, if we want to experience Krishna in the
temple, at least, some level of sense control is required. Now, that is not
easy. But that is not impossible. That level of self-control, everybody can
have. So, "tāni sarvāṇi saṁyamya". First, there is control. And then, there is
concentration. That one con..., concentrates the mind on Krishna. And after one
concentrates the mind on Krishna, then there is conquest. Control.
Concentration. Conquest. So, "vaśe". "vaśe" means, in this way, we conquer them.
So, that which was. So, like, the horse is, first, it has to be "saṁyamya". So,
if a horse is reighing widly, and you know, is, sorry, horse is neighing wildly,
and is completely berserk. So, at that time, a horse trainer has to first, the
horse is just thread, due to run here and there. And it is there, it is carol.
But it is, its staple, but in a fence. But it is running here, running there.
And if anybody goes near. Tuck. The horse knocks the person down. So, then,
initially, what the horse trainer has to do is, first get a grip on the saddle.
Guess on the, on the sa..., have a saddle. And have a rein. And try to get some
grip on the horse. So, that is "saṁyamya". So, the horse is running wild. But
there is some amount of restraint. And then, after that, then one trains the
horse. One gets the horse to understand. But actually, if it behaves itself.
Then, it will get food. It will get nourishment. It will get love. It will be
taken care of. And understand, then, after that, the horse becomes calm. And
then, there is "vaśe". Then, the horse is conquered. So, we begin with control.
And then, after that, you know, we, the horse, co..., focuses here and there. We
will focus on horse. Ok. You will get this gra.... You will get this hay. You
will get this grass. You will get this food. Just calm down. So, like that, when
the mind is restless, even when the Krishna is right in front of us as the
deity, as the holy name. Still, we just cannot focus. And we cannot see at,
there devata, nourishment available for me. Here, there is satisfaction
available for me. So, after control, there is concentration. And after
concentration, there is conquest. Then, after the senses become conquered. So,
Krishna says, one who does like this, such a person is "tasya prajñā
pratiṣṭhitā". Such a person is well-situated. The "prajñā" is "pratiṣṭhitā". The
intelligence is well-situated. Now, after describing this, Krishna will move
forward in the verse to answer the question of Arjuna about "kim vrajeta". So,
of course, before He goes to that, He tells, what will happen if one fails to do
this. So, Krishna does a very smooth transition. So, in "āsīta", He also uses
the word "yukta". "yukta" means connected or engaged. So, that eng..., what is
that engagement? Krishna will tell in 64. But here, he is continuing the point
that one has, if one fails to fix the mind on Krishna. And instead, one fixes
the mind on something else. But if one lets the mind prey on the sense objects,
then what happens? So, in this verse, the primary point is that, you know, that
control alo..., if we are just trying to control, control, control, that will
fail if we do not take it through the next steps. If we do not take it to
concentration and conquest, then control itself will fail. Because control, how
long can we continue it? You know, the, mind will go wild. And eventually, it
will lock us down. So, if we want to move forward from control to concentration,
then, then we have to actually fix the mind on Krishna. And when we fix on the
mind on Krishna, then gradually, there will be conquest. So, in the purport,
Srila Prabhupada talks about Durvāsā Mun..., or, so, or the conflict between
Durvāsā Muni and Ambarīṣa Mahārāja. And now, from the point of view, varnashram.
Varnashram, Durvāsā Muni, both in terms of varna and ashrama was higher than
Ambarīṣa Mahārāja. There are four varṇas. So, the ksatriyas are second. Brahmana
was first. So, brahmanas are higher than ksatriyas. Similarly, among the four
ashramas, th..., the, Durva..., Am..., Ambarīṣa Mahārāja was a grihasta. Durvāsā
Muni was sannyasi. So, both of the varṇa and the ashrama point of view, Durvāsā
Muni was higher. But he had not done mat-paraḥ. His mind was not fixed on
Krishna. His mind was fixed on, he was, he wa..., whatever kind of meditation he
was doing. But at least, within this pastime, he was focused more on the fact
that I am a renunciate. I am a great sage. And I deserve to be honored. So, his
consciousness was not on Krishna. On the other hand, Ambarīṣa Mahārāja was
"mat-paraḥ". And how was he "mat-paraḥ"? That, for that, Srila Prabhupada quotes
a series of verses from the Bhagavatam which describe how one can fix the mind
and senses on Krishna. So, let us look at these verses.

        sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor
         vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane
        karau harer mandira-mārjanādiṣu
         śrutiṁ cakārācyuta-sat-kathodaye

So, first and foremost, it all begins with "manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor". One
fixes the mind on the lotus feet of Krishna. Now, we may say how can I fix the
mind on Krishna directly? Actually, at least, there has to be the intention to
fix the mind on Krishna. So, we need the senses. And the, when we engage the
senses, it becomes easier to fix the mind on Krishna. But at least, the
intention has to be there. Yes, I want to think about Krishna. I want to fix the
mind on Krishna. So, then, when that intention onwards, then one starts engaging
the senses, also. And when the senses become engaged. Then, naturally, the mind
also becomes engaged. So, let us see now how we engage the senses. "vacāṁsi
vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane". So, "vacāṁsi", with his speech, what did he do?
"vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane". He described the glories of Vaikuṇṭha. Now,
"vaikuṇṭha" get refered to the abode of the Lord. And "vaikuṇṭha" is also one of
the names of Lord Vishnu. Now, you know, in the Vishnu Sahasranama as well as in
the Eighth Canto, "vaikuṇṭha" is one of the incarnations of Vishnu who appears.
So, he describes the glories of "vaikuṇṭha". "karau harer mandira-mārjanādiṣu".
So, "karau" is the hands. With the hands, what did he do? "mandira-mārjanā". He
uses the hands to clean the temple. And then, "śrutiṁ" is hear. "śrutiṁ
cakārācyuta-sat-kathodaye". So, "śrutiṁ", "cakārācyuta-sat-kathodaye". That
Supreme Lord, who is all-attractive. Who is the essence of everything.
"sat-kathodaye". The auspicious. The eternal. The true kathā of Him. In this
world, we are hearing the kathā of so many people, in this world. You know, the
whole newspapers are actually filled with the "kathā" of people. There is
"kathā" of politicians, of cricketers, of, you know, of business people, of
business scamsters, of criminals. So, there are "kathā" of so many people. 32:40
