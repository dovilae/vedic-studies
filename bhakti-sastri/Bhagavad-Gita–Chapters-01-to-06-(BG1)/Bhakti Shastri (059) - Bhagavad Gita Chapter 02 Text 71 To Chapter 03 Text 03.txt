Hare Krishna.

Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. So, we are now coming
to the last part of the second chapter. In the second chapter, Krishna talks
about various things. So, let us look at an overview of the second chapter
quickly before we move forward. So, chapter two overview. The, it has five
sections. We are in the last, this fifth section. So, the first section was
Arjuna's further doubts and surrender. The second section was based on the
knowledge that we are not the body. We are the soul. One should fight. So, this
counters Arjuna's argu..., compassion argument. You know, that, fight. And then,
second section, the third section, second section of Krishna's instructions. 31
to 38 is karma-kanda. So, what, that is the first application of atma-jnana.
Fight by doing prescribed duties, you will enjoy. This counters Arjuna's
enjoyment argument. Then 39 to 53, that is the fourth section of the chapter.
That is Nishkama Karma Yoga. So, first appli..., second application of
atma-jnana means that first one understands. Ok, if I am not going to die, then
let me, you know, if I, I will not be finished at death, then let me seek
something higher. So, one s..., thinks, aspires for heaven. But when one truly
understands that I am eternal and heaven is not eternal, then I will not, that
which is eternal, and for that, I have to become detached from material things.
So, fight with detachment. Then, no sinful reaction. So, this counters Arjuna's
enjoyment argument. And that, 54 to 72 is the characteristics of a
sthita-prajna. This based on, you know, Arjuna inquiring what kind of person
will stay detached. So, he wants to know whether such a person will fight or
not. What are the characteristic of such a person? So, we are in that section
right now. So, let us look at 71 and 72. Now, before we look at 71. The, there,
Srila Prabhupada makes a very profound point over here that a:

"person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is happy in the service of the Lord, and he has
no desires to be fulﬁlled."

So, basically, this is paraphrase of the famous Chaitanya Charitamrita verse.

        bhukti-mukti-siddhi-kāmī — sakali ‘aśānta’

And that is what is taught in the previous verse, previous sentence of the
purport. And:

        kṛṣṇa-bhakta — niṣkāma, ataeva ‘śānta’

So, now, Prabhupada says over here:

"he does not even desire liberation from the so-called material bondage."

So, actually, for a devotee, there is no material bondage only. So, even,
material bondage becomes so called bondage. So, very few, you know, if any
acharyas had called material bondage as so called bondage. Yes. Ji..., Rupa
Goswami does say that one who is situated in Krishna Consciousness:

	īhā yasya harer dāsye
	karmaṇā manasā girā
	nikhilāsv apy avasthāsu
	jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate

So, the concept of "jīvan-muktaḥ" is there. "jīvan-muktaḥ". There are two kinds
of mukti. There is videha-mukti. And jīvan-mukti. "videha-mukti" means when we
give up the body. And we become liberated, and go back to the spiritual
world. That is "videha". "videha" means without body. So, when one become
liberated compa..., completely. And jivan-mukti means one is in the body. But
while being in the body, one is not affected by the modes. One is not affected,
shaken up and down. That is jivan-mukti. So, Rupa Goswami quotes from the
scripture saying that, one who is completely absorbed with body, mind and words
in the service of the Lord, "īhā yasya harer dāsye". "ya...", "īhā" means in
this world. "yasya harer dāsye karmaṇā manasā girā". With body, mind and words,
you know, with actions, words and s..., thoughts. "nikhilāsv apy avasthāsu".
Such a person is situated always in service of the Lord. "jīvan-muktaḥ sa
ucyate". Such a person is "jīvan-muktaḥ". So, Prabhupada is talking about a, a,
for such a devotee, thus so called material bondage. Material bondage is not
actually real. It is just a, just a, a parishion. A parishion means, it is a,
there is no actual bondage. The devotee is already liberated. Now, Prahlada
Maharaja also says this when he says that I am not concerned about getting
liberated from material existence. I am simply concerned about how others will
gain your shelter, and others will attain liberation. Why? Because I am
relishing:

        tvad-vīrya-gāyana-mahāmṛta-magna-cittaḥ

I am relishing the nectar of your glories. So, now, let us move forward. In the
next verse.

        vihāya kāmān yaḥ sarvān
        pumāṁś carati niḥspṛhaḥ
        nirmamo nirahaṅkāraḥ
        sa śāntim adhigacchati

So, "vihāya". "vihāya" means to give up. "kāmān". "kāmān" is material desires.
"yaḥ sarvān". So, one who gives up all material de..., yaḥ s..., desires.
"pumāṁś carati". So, the "carati". The whole question was. You know, "kim
vrajeta". This is answer to that question. So, "carati". Such a person moves
around. How does that person move around? "niḥspṛhaḥ". Without any desires.
Hmm. "nirmamo nirahaṅkāraḥ". "n...", "nirmamo". Without any possessiveness.
"nirahaṅkāraḥ". Without any, you know, you know, "kartaha mitimani" without any
arrogance. Without any possessiveness. "sa śāntim adhigacchati". Such a person
will attain peace. Such a person will attain satisfaction in life. "sa śāntim".
So, now, what are the charac..., what are the requirements of "sa śāntim"? One
gives up material desires. And without material desires, one moves around in the
world. And without possessiveness. Without false ego. So, basically, one
understand that I am a soul. And I am working in this world for the sake of
yoga, not for gaining anything in this world. So, "śāntim adhigacchati". Such a
person will attain happiness. Now, you know, this verse, how is it related with
the previous verse? It is continuing the theme. The previous theme said, was,
said that, actually, just as rivers come into the ocean. But the ocean is not
disturbed. Similarly, desires come into the person, but the person is not
disturbed. Such a person attains peace. Now, this verse contains, so, now, that
ver..., that verse is talking more of a, you know, of the internal consciousness
of a person. But this verse talks about "carati". Ok, with that internal
consciousness, one moves around in the world. But one is not motivated by any
material desires or any material conceptions. So, such a person is happy. So,
actually, as long as we have any desires, especially material desire, that makes
us restless. That makes us take, you know, lose our peace. Now, when we have
spiritual desire, the desire to serve Krishna. Does that take away our peace? We
could say it takes away our peace. But it increases our remembrance of Krishna.
And when our, when our remembrance of Krishna is intensified, actually, that is
the perfection of life. That is what enables us to become truly happy. So, what
we need is remembrance of Krishna at all times. And, you know, you know, you
know, desires that increase our remembrance of Krishna, they are auspicious
desires. So, devotee has spiritual desires. And those desires actually take us
to a platform of supreme peace. That is the peace of knowing that Krishna is
always there with me. And I am always connected with Krishna. So, you know,
there is the peace of the mind. And there is the peace of the heart. Peace of
the mind is the peace of having no anxieties. There is, you know, no worry.
There is no fear. That is peace of the mind. But beyond peace of the mind is
peace of the heart. Peace of the heart is based on love. When we know that we
are in a loving relationship. And that relationship is eternal. And that
relationship is unbreakable. And whatever we are doing is actually to strengthen
and deepen that relationship. Then, you know, every situation that comes up,
that only becomes an opportunity to further that relationship. And in such a
situation, nothing can break one's peace. So, Bha..., K..., Bhagavad Gita talks
about peace of the heart, not just peace of the mind.

So, we will have desires. But because those desires are peripheral, you know,
you now, are not peripheral to our central being. Material desires are
peripheral to our central being. They have nothing to do with us as souls. But
spiritual desires are centered to our spiritual being. And those desires take us
closer to Krishna. They, as I said, deepen and strengthen our relationship with
Krishna. And that is why they bring supreme happiness. So, such a, Krishna says,
such a person is actually peaceful. Who? That person who is detached from
everything material. The Bhagavad Gita is f..., progressing in its own thought
and it will bring Krishna in the center later. Right now, Kr..., Krishna is
focusing on detachment from the negative. Later on, he will start talking about
attachment to the positive. So, it will happen progressively. Right now, he is
talking about detachment from the negative. So, you know, such a, "sa śāntim
adhigacchati". To extent a person is free from material desires, to that extent
the person will be happy. Now, Srila Prabhupada, in the purport, talks about
what is actually desirelessness.

"To become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratiﬁcation. In
other words, desire for becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious is actually desirelessness."

So, how is it desirelessness? Because that is simply our nature. You know, for a
water to be liquid, it is not actually desire. It is nature. Similarly, for the
soul to serve Krishna, it is not actually desire. It is nature. It is within the
platform of being a servant of Krishna. There can be world..., multiple ways in
which the devotee can aspire to serve Krishna. But overall, that is not a
foreign desire to the nature of the soul. That is its, a part of its intrinsic
fabric, its intrinsic nature. So, Krishna is telling Arjuna, fight with such
detachment. Then, you will not be bound. And then, now, He describes the
concluding verse.

        eṣā brāhmī sthitiḥ pārtha
        naināṁ prāpya vimuhyati
        sthitvāsyām anta-kāle ’pi
        brahma-nirvāṇam ṛcchati

So, "eṣā". "eṣā" is this. "brāhmī sthitiḥ". "brāhmī sthitiḥ" is spiritual
situation. "pārtha". "naināṁ prāpya vimuhyati". Once one has attained this, one
will not become deluded. One will not come under "moha", "muhyati".
"sthitvāsyām". When one is situated, thus "sthitvā". "anta-kāle ’pi". Even at
the moment of death. "brahma-nirvāṇam ṛcchati". So, one will attain
"brahma-nirvāṇam". One will attain supreme liberation. So, "eṣā". "eṣā" means
thus. So, Krishna is, what is this "eṣā" referring to? It is referring to what
was given in the earlier verses. So, 70 and 71 talked about this stage of
"śāntim". And Krishna is saying, if one will, stays in the stage of "śāntim",
"eṣā brāhmī sthitiḥ pārtha". There will be two results. First results is, one
will not be deluded a..., again. And second result, he says, one will become
liberated. So, "A" and "B" are talking about not deluded.

        eṣā brāhmī sthitiḥ pārtha
        naināṁ prāpya vimuhyati

If we attain this stage, then we will not fall again into illusion. And
"sthitvāsyām", if we can be situated like this, at the time of dea...,
"anta-kāle ’pi". Then one will attain liberation. Now, this is the first
reference in the Gita to the significance of "anta-kāle". That we have to, you
know, have some special consciousness at the moment of death. And we have to
strive to cultivate that consciousness. That is, you know, a theme which will be
talked about, you know, quite empathetically in the Eighth Chapter of the
Bhagavad Gita. But this is the prelude. So, as the Chapter is in t..., is in
title, "Contents of the Gītā Summarized". So, the various contents, Karma Yoga,
Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga. Which are the various yogas. They are talked about in
summary. So, similarly, the significance of the moment of death, that is also
talked about. So, it is hinted at. Just we have to remember at the time of
death. And, and, essen..., in the last verse of the Seventh Chapter, Krishna
will refer to this. And immediately, Eighth Chapter, Krishna will ask a
question. Say, the, ask for, so, Eighth Chapter, Arjuna will ask a question.
And then, Krishna will elaborate on moment of death. So, "brāhmī sthitiḥ". These
words have a lot of significance. Normally, the word "brahman" is neutral
gender. So, in English, there are two genders. There is masculine gender. And
there is feminine gender. So, he is masculine. She is feminine. You know, now,
in sanskrit, there is a third gender. Neutral gender. So, you know, this third
gender is used for describing various objects as appropriate in sanskrit
language. So, in the, you know, "Hari-namamrta-vyakarana", you know, Jiva
Goswami gives spiritual names for the various r..., concepts and rules of
grammar. You know, as the name itself suggests, "hari", "nam", "amrit",
"vyakaran". So, the "vyakaran" is grammar. "hari", "nam" is holy names. "amrit".
So, then, the, the, the grammar, that is based on the nectar of the holy names.
So, in the "Hari-namamrta-vyakarana", Jiva Goswami tries to, or, Jiva Goswami
actually sp..., devotionalises the, all the rules of grammar. And he uses the
rules accordingly. So, now, when he does this. He uses the rules accordingly.
So, he g..., gives spiritual names to the genders, also. So, for example,
masculine gender, he calls as Narayan linga. And the feminine gender, he calls
as the Lakshmi linga. So, there, the neutral gender, he calls as Brahma linga.
So, Brahma linga is neutral gender. Because Brahman itself does not, the
conception of Brahman is based on an understanding, the, of the concepts, you
know, which is preliminary. You know, it is not a complete understanding of the
Absolute Truth. So, it is understanding of Brahman, Abso..., of the Absolute
Truth is ordinary potencies. So, the point which I am making over here is,
generally, Brahman is considered to be neutral gender. That is the way it is
normally used in sanskrit. But here, Krishna is using a word "brāhmī sthitiḥ".
So, Brahman is masculine. Brahman is neutral. But "brāhmī" is feminine. So,
"brāhmī sthitiḥ" refers to the feminine gender. So, this can, this can be taken
as a hint towards Radharani. You know, Radharani is the ultimate, you know,
ultimate mediatrix. It is medium. And mediatrix. So, ma..., the feminine of
medium is mediatrix. So, why a media, we say. So, she is the mediatrix. She is
the means by which we attain Krishna. It is by her grace that we attain the
grace of Krishna. So, that Radharani is the, you know, person who gives bhakti
to everyone. So, "brāhmī". Because she is the f..., mas..., she is the feminine
aspect to the Absolute Truth. As a "brāhmī" can be taken to refer to that
Radharani, also. Now, "naināṁ prāpya vimuhyati". So, once we are situated in
that brahman stage, then one will not be deluded. This will be referred to by
Krishna again in 9.13:

        mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha
        daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ

You, these two are the references to Radharani in the Bhagavad Gita. Of course,
both are indirect. In, in fact, when Srila Prabhupada in his "Bhagavad-Gītā As It
Is" also refers to Radharani only once. And that is where, that is in the
invocation:

        tapta-kāñcana-gaurāṅgi
        rādhe vṛndāvaneśvari

That is the only place where he refers to Radharani. So, Radharani is very
exalted topic. And Srila Prabhupada, of course, does give us some hints of
Gaudiya Vaishnava, exoteric truths in the Bhagavad Gita. But his primary focus
is on, you know, on giving us systematic understanding of the fundamental
concepts of, you know, spirituality. So, he wanted Bhagavad Gita to be a book
which could be distributed to such a people in general. And for that purpose, he
presented the "Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is". So, now, Prabhupada, in the purport,
mentions about, so there is, is a, so there is a state of Krishna Consciousness
which we attain, then we will not fall back into illusion. "naināṁ prāpya
vimuhyati". So, it is a very advanced stage. But once one attains that stage,
one cannot fall back. And, you know, once when one is situated, thus one will be
liberated. So, Prabhupada's state..., the, focuses on when, now, g..., the
question. When will we attain it? So:

"One can attain Kṛṣṇa consciousness or divine life at once, within a second – or
one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births. It is
only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact."

So, once we understand and accept the fact, then we can attain spiritual life.
We can attain Krishna Consciousness. You know, and when one is situated thus at
the moment of death. You know, this is the godly way of life, Prabhupada says.
Once we are situated thus, we become liberated. So, Srila Prabhupada, in his
purports, does something extraordinary. So, let us look at what exactly he does.
So, Prabhupada's strategy in the Bhagavad Gita is very deeply thought out. You
know. Prabhupada explains his, he calls his Bhagavad Gita as "Bhagavad-Gītā As
It Is". And in the "Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is", he is giving us systematic
understanding of the various concepts. You know, but his focus is on ensuring
that we get the understanding of the conclusions clearly. So, he focuses on
ensuring that our understanding of the conclusion of bhakti remains, you know,
consistently in the forefront of our consciousness. The Bhagavad Gita talks
about many concepts. And Prabhupada addresses those concepts, also, in his
purports. But the speciality of Prabhupada's presentation was that whatever
aspect of scripture he is presenting, he presents it in connection with the
conclusive message of the scripture. And in this way, he makes sure that what is
most important is not lost from our vision. You know, what is most important
stays with us. And it enables us to move forward in our spiritual life. So,
looking at the second chapter, Krishna has concluded by how one can bec..., stay
"sthita-prajña". And how one can attain liberation. So, now, let us move to the
third chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. I will come back to Srila Prabhupada's
presentation once again a little later.

So, the third chapter has 43 verses. The second chapter was among the longest
chapters. The longest chapter in the Bhagavad Gita is the 18th which has 78
verses. The second longest chapter is this chapter, s..., two, which has 72
verses. And the third chapter is also among the longer chapters. Of course, it
is not as long. There are fif..., so, 55 verses at the end, the Eleventh
Chapter. 47 verses are there in the Sixth chapter. So, there are longer
chapters. But generally, the ve..., chapters which are having more than forty
verses, they are among the longer chapters of the Gita. So, this is among the
longer chapters. And this is called by Srila Prabhupada as "Karma-yoga". And
that is a standard name which most commentators have used for the chapter. Let
us look at the overview. So, the first verse, one to ten, of course, verses one
and two are Arjuna's question. And a..., a..., in response to that, Krishna is
speaking. Karma-yoga is better than jnana-yoga. Now, this chapter's flow has to
be carefully understood. Then, a, from 10 onwards, 10 to 16, if you are not
qualified for jnana-yoga, then practice k..., karma-kanda, so, if not qualified
karma-yoga, then practice karma-kanda. Then, if you are qualified for
jnana-yoga, still practice karma-yoga to set an example. And then, there is a
description of the differences between karma-yoga and karma-kanda, from 25 to
29. And then, from 30 to 35, there is a description how karma-yoga elevates. And
then, th..., 36 to 43, there is, overcome lust, the main obstacle on the path of
karma-yoga. So, l..., now, the flow of this chapter is, is not linear. It is
spiral. What do we mean by spiral? You know, when a spiral is there, it v...,
i..., or object moves like this. And then tuck. It moves like this. So, it moves
circularly. And then it moves forward. So, while moving a forward trajectory, it
is also taking a circular trajectory. So, like that, this chapter is focusing on
the conclusion that Arjuna should practice karma-yoga. But how does the chapter
flow towards that conclusion? There is a proc..., progression. That progression
22:33
