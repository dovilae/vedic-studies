So, in this section, Sixth Chapter onwards. You know. When Krishna gradually,
evolves His thought, the thought, development of the precincts of yoga, He
eventually moves on to talk about, you know, samadhi. You know, when we are
talking about samadhi. There are different levels of samadhi. So, let us look at
these levels. And then, we will look at Srila Prabhupada's purport. So, here, we
can see, m..., Samprajnata Samadhi. And Asamprajnata Samadhi. So, Samprajnata.
M..., so, that is at the stable, level of ekagrata. Remember, we discussed five
levels of mind control. We start, you know, discussed about mudha, kshipta,
vikshipta, ekagrata and niroddha. So, niroddha. N..., n..., so, now, when we are
discussing these five levels, there is samadhi. It is not like a digital zero,
one. Samadhi is also like analog. We are progress, the yogi goes progressively
deeper and deeper into samadhi. So, when there are different kinds of samadhi.
So, Samprajnata Samadhi means that actually the mind is focused. And the mind is
calm. It is focused on one particular thing. Generally speaking, our mind go...,
is wandering over dozens of things at the same time. Just thinking of this and
that. And that. Hundreds of things like that. But at the level of Samprajnata
Samadhi, the mind is focused on one thing. And after being focused on one thing,
then the mind moves forward onwards. You know. Eventually, the mind at the
material level stops thinking. Stop, when the mind stops, that is called as
Asamprajnata Samadhi. So, remember, we discussed earlier about the, you know,
television example or a virtual reality example when a person is looking at the
television, the emotions are all caught up in whatever is happening on the
television set, on the screen. So, like that, our emotions are caught up. But
within the material world, although there is so much illusion, Krishna also
manifests. Krishna manifests as the holy name. Krishna manifests as the deity.
Is, Krishna manifests as the, you know, scrip..., scriptures. So, when we fix
our mind on these manifestations of Krishna, that is samadhi. And for the yogi,
also, now, we, now, here, samadhi, if we talk it from the, first, let us
understand the concept samadhi. Then, talk about how it happens, you know, on
the path of yoga. Now, when the mind is, Asamprajnata Samadhi means when the
mind is stopped. That means, you know, instead of just focusing on one thing
within the TV, you know, just person, just l..., stops looking at the TV. Turns
away from the TV. And it looks elsewhere. So, that is a higher level. Why is
that the higher level? Because at that level, one has not at all connected with
the illusion. So, the mind is stopped. So, there is Samprajnata and
Asamprajnata. And n..., now, that means, Samprajnata means that the mind is
conscious of the material level of reality. But within the material level of
reality, the focus is on, you know, s..., a spiritual concept. Whereas at the
level of Samprajnata Samadhi, the mind is completely turned away from material
reality. And it is focused directly on spiritual reality. So, now, within
Samprajnata Samadhi. So, Samprajnata, so among these five levels, Samprajnata is
at the level of ekagrata. The mind is focused. Whereas Asamprajnata is the mind
is stopped. So, then, one turns inwards. M..., so, now, let us look at this once
again.

Now, within the ekagrata stage, within the ekagrata stage, there is, there are
two kinds of samadhis for the, Savitarka and Savicara Samadhi. So, Savitarka
Samadhi means that an external object is used to focus the mind. So, their
external object may be, one may start by fixing the mind on tip of the nose.
Or you know:

        nāsikāgraṁ svaṁ 

As we discussed in this chapter, Sixth Chapter itself, in 6.13. Or it may be
"bhruvor madhye". When we fix the on the middle of the eyebrows. So, one takes
an external o..., object. Or one may also look at some external mudra, or, so,
external yantra. Not mudra. Yantra is a particular diagram that can help one
focus on higher con..., obj..., you know, higher realities. So, like that, there
can be various things which one can try to focus on. Now, when we are at least
trying to focus on such things, the essential principle is that one wants to
move from lower level of reality, that is material reality. To higher level of
reality. It is spiritual reality. So, if an external object helps one in
concentrating that way, one can use that. So, now, this is not considered a very
high level of concentration. Because one requires an external object to
concentrate it, to tur..., concentrate and to turn inwards. That is Savitarka,
now, beyond that, one may take an internal conception to focus. So, when one
takes the conception to focus, at that time, also, you know, one is able to
focus. But the focus, even at that time, is on the thought. That now we
understand that the reality that three levels. There is physical. Then, there is
mental. And then, there is spiritual. So, when one ta..., uses some object from
physical reality as a center point, as a cen..., focal point for concentration,
then that is Savitarka Samadhi. Then, when one moves forward, then takes a m...,
o..., object at the mental level of reality. That means one takes a thought, or
a conception. And focuses on that. That means it may, we say the yogi wants to
meditate and one may think of an image of Krishna. So, one is not really, it is
not a revelation coming from the spiritual level. It is a conception that we are
trying to have in the mind. So, when one tries to concentrate on a thought, that
is a Savicara. Savicara means there is thought. There is thought. You know,
m..., now, is thought bad? It is not that thought is bad. But at the current
level of conception, at the material level of consciousness, even the thoughts
that we have are material. And when one is having material thoughts, one cannot
be considered to be at the spiritual level of consciousness. So, Savicara
Samadhi means that one is at a mental level of conception. And one is not
necessarily at a spiritual level of conception. But one chooses a mental
conception. One chooses an obj..., a thought for contemplation that helps us to
thin..., one to go inwards. That helps to one's consciousness to raise higher.
So, this is Savicara Samadhi. Now, all this, which we are discussing is largely
from the Patanjali Yoga Stura. Where he talks about it. And there are
commentaries written on that, also, by various, you know, you know, scholarly
commentators. Which explains this futher. So, this is the level of Samadhis in,
you know, Asam..., Samprajnata. And then, after that, when one moves to the
a..., next level of reality. That is when one moves to the h..., level of
reality where there is no connection at the physical level. So, one does not
need the physical thought. Nor does one need a mental, one does not need a
physical object. Nor does one need a mental object. One is directly at the
spiritual level. So, that is the higher level of samadhi. And one comes to that
level of samadhi, you know, you know, then, that person is considered to have
attained, a..., within the yogic path, perfection. So:

        yogas chitta vritti nirodha

As we di..., discussed. What is the principle of yoga? "chitta vritti nirodha".
"chitta vritti" is the moment of consciousness. "nirodha", control. So, it is
stopping completely. Cessation. So, the material moment of consciousness stops.
This is the understanding of progressive perfection with respect to the path of
yoga. Now, in the bhakti understanding, also, there is samadhi. Now, for the
devotee, the samadhi does not necessarily have to have, a..., cessation of
activity at the physical or the mental level. That may be there. But, you know,
that is not the essential point. The essential point is, not cessation of
activity at the material, physical, or mental level. But it is the stimulation
of activity. It is the at, a stimulation of activity at the devotional level.
That means the devotee starts perceiving higher reality. And not just
perceiving, but participating in higher reality. What is the difference between
perceiving and participating? Perceiving means that for example, sometimes,
th..., we read in the pastime to the Goswamis. The Goswamis are si..., sitting
and meditating on Krishna. And then, Krishna's pastimes started being perceived
by them. So, Krishna's pastimes are happening in the spiritual world. You know.
But they are perceiving it. So, that is samadhi. That means what is happening?
They are no longer acting at the physical, mental level. But that is not the
essence of samadhi. Essence of samadhi is, they are perceiving and participating
in reality at the spiritual level. So, we have the example of Rupa Goswami. You
know. You know. Once he was sitting and m..., m..., m..., doing devotional
meditation. And at that time, he was observing the pastimes of Krishna. And
then, the pastime, Radha and Krishna were in the forest. And when they were in
the forest, Radharani saw a beautiful flower. Which was high up on the tree. So,
then, on a branch of the tree. So, Radharani wanted that flower. And she could
not reach. So, Krishna said, I will lift you up. And Krishna came from
behind and lifted her up. And as she reached the flower. And as she was holding
onto the branch to pack out the flower, Krishna let go. And then, Krishna let
go. And Radharani has cried out in fear. And she held onto the branch. And the
branch was not so strong. And Radharani was crying in fear. And Krishna started
laughing. And seeing this, the stitious nature of Krishna, Rupa Goswami started
laughing. And Rupa Goswami started laughing. At that time, there was a, a
vaishnava, who was passing by that area. Now, this vaishnava happened to be
lame. So, he was walking with a limb. And when he was passing by, at that time,
Rupa Goswami observed this pa..., meditation, this par..., pastime, this
meditation. And started laughing. So, that devotee thought that Rupa Goswami is
laughing at me. And he got upset by that. You know. Why is he laughing at me?
And as soon as, you know, Rupa Goswami got upset, this, you know, Ru..., so
that, that Vaishnava got upset. Rupa Goswami's trans broke. And you know, there,
the, just, wonderful pastime was relishing. What happened? And he tried to
meditate. But the pastime did not come back. And then, he understood, probably,
I am, I must have done something which was, so displeased the devotee. And
because of this, my vision of pastime went off. And then, m..., m..., it is
elaborate story. Then, he considered Sanatan Goswami, Sanatan Goswami said, you
invite all the Vaishnavas for a feast. Whoever does not come, that is a
vaishnava that is displeased. You find out who it was. And then you go, and, you
know, seek forgiveness. So, then, he invited all the vaishnavas for a feast. And
that vaishnava did not come. Then, he went and asked what happened. And then,
when that vaishnava revealed his heart. That, you know, you were laughing at me.
He said. No. No. I was not laughing at you. He explained. And then, the whole
situation was clarified. So, the point here is that, there is perception of
higher reality. So, for a devotee, samadhi is not just:

        yogas chitta vritti nirodha

Not just disconnection from physical realm, mental reality. It is stimulation.
Activation of, you know, you know, perception of spiritual reality. So, now,
s..., perception is one thing. That means one sees the higher reality. But a
dev..., for a devotee, samadhi is even higher. It is not just perception. But
there is also participation. Participation means that the devotee actually
pursues the higher reality of Krishna. And then, not only pursues, but also
recognises that I have a role in that pastime. And the devotee participates in
that pastime, also. So, there is another pa..., pastime of Raghunatha dasa
Goswami. When you know, one day, the devotee is found. The devotee was serving
him. Found that he was sick. And then, they called the vaidya. And the vaidya
said that his stomach is upset. And the reason for the stomach upset is that he
has overeaten. So, the devotees were annoyed. Outraged. They said, you are
committing a vaishnava aparadha. You know. Rupa, Raghunatha dasa Goswami does
not eat anything, practically. They say, he drinks, takes a little butter milk
in one, in two or three days. So, how can you say that he has offended? He has,
you know, he has overeaten? No, he said. But that is the, the symptoms indicate
that he has overeaten. And they asked Rupa Go..., Raghunatha dasa Goswami. This is
what this vaidya says. He says, it is true. Actually, there was a celebration,
there was a festival in the spiritual world. And at that time, kheer had been
cooked, you know, by Radharani for Krishna. And then, all the sakhis, and the
manjaris, they had the remnants of Krishna. So, the kheer was so delicious that
we overate. So, I also overate. So, now, he, and then, he said now, so, what had
happened at the spiritual level, that affected at the material level, also. So,
at the physical level, also, the body got upset. So, there is also, this
conception of manas puja. Where, in Nectar of Devotion, this pastime is
described. That a devotee tries to serve Krishna by offering, you know, a kheer
in the mind. The devotee is very poor. And he tries to offer kheer. But he, he
wants to offer the best worship to Krishna. The best bhoga to Krishna. But he
does not have anything to offer. So, he offers kheer. And when he offers kheer.
At that time, he prepares the kheer in the mind. It is, mind, I will offer. And
he offers it de..., very elaborately. Makes it very delicious. And then, before
offering, one has to test. You know. We treat Krishna as a person. So, it should
not be too hot. So, he is about to offer it, at that time, he finds that,
actually, it is not offerable. He wants to check whether it is ho..., a, cool
enough. And he just put..., touches his finger. And as soon he touches his
finger, in his meditation, touching the finger, but aaa..., his finger, oh, his
finger, it feels if hot sensation on his finger. And opens eyes. And his finger
is actually burnt. So, then, here, what is happening, actually, the devotional
contemplation is making what is a higher reality manifested at a lower level,
also. What is a spiritual level, manifested at a material level, also. So, the
point here is, for a devotee, samadhi is not just passive meditation. It is
active, not just perception, but active participation. Devotee, for a devotee,
samadhi is not just passive perception. But active participation. And this is
the samadhi which we see Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was in repeatedly.

Actually, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's transes of ecstasy, you know, can be seen at
three levels. At this level, we can say that, one level is that he, there was
the perception. There was percep..., so, these are similar to what I have been
saying, perception and participation. But there are, a, levels in it. Perception
means, Caitanya Mahaprabhu  would be, at one moment, with other devotees. And
they would be discussing Krishna Katha. Hearing some verses from the Bhagavatam.
Some shl..., songs of Krishna. And suddenly, Caitanya Mahaprabhu would see in
the, they are walking through Ja..., through Jagannath Puri on the road. And in
Jagannath, Vallabha gardens. Suddenly, Caitanya Mahaprabhu would see Krishna.
And when he would see Krishna, he would see Krishna playing his flute. And
suddenly would run, leaving all the other devotees. Charge away at full speed.
And then, you know, he would go, and, you know, charged towards Krishna to
embrace Krishna's lotus feet. To take Krishna's shelter. And then going to reach
there, just as about to reach there, he would faint. And when he would f..., and
Krishna would disappear. And he would faint. And the devotees would come and
ask. What happened? What happened? He says, I saw Krishna. But Krishna
disappeared. I am so unfortunate. This was for, for the first time in Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. You know. He took sannyasa at Katwa. And then, he was going towards
Vrindavan. But he was brought back to, you know, to others', acharyas', Prabhu's
place in Santipur. So, this was, at that time, also, you know, Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu had such a mystical visions. So, this is, when one is the, with
others. But suddenly, one s..., pursues a higher reality. Now, this is not an
imagination. Actually, Krishna is present. And the devotee gets temporary
glimpses of Krishna. That is also samadhi. Then, beyond that, there can also be
not just perception. So, K..., suddenly, Krishna, Caitanya Mahaprabhu has run away.
But then, when he would actually not just get a glimpse, but he would
participate in Krishna's pastimes. So, when he would participate in Krishna's
pastime, he will say that, he, Caitanya Mahaprabhu, this was one pastime when he
would, you know, for exam..., this comes in the Antya lila, Caitanya Maha...,
Chaitanya Charitamrita, 18th Chapter, I think, where there is a fisherman. And
that fisherman, one day, catches a fish. And he becomes very happy because just
caught a giant fish. Giant fish. And as he pulls out the giant fish, he says,
hey, what is this? It is not a fish. It is some strange being. And at that
night, the devotee has found. Caitanya Mahaprabhu has disappeared. And
frantically searching everywhere. And then, they find this fisherman who is, you
know, acting like a mad man. And they ask, what happened? You know, just
chanting. He is just ch..., he is frantically chanting the names of Vishnu, of
Krishna. And he is frantic, practically. You know, they ask him, what happened?
What happened? So, he said that, you know, I caught a fish. You know. And
actually, when I, I, he says, I have been haunted by a ghost. He says, you know,
normally, I chant Nrsimha mantra to drive away ghost. But I do not know what
kind of ghost has haunted me. The more this time, the more I chant Nrsimha
mantra, the more haunting increases. So, then, Janakin asked, what has
happened? I, I, I want to find the exorcist who will drive the ghost. So, then,
you know, amongst the associates of, of Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Swarup Damodar was
there, a secretary of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He says, I am an exorcist. I know. I
will drive away the ghost. And what he does is, tuck, he slaps among the fierce.
You know. And he says, what happened? Where, what, how did you get the ghost? He
said, it has now caught a giant fish. And then, you know, as soon as he tried to
touch the fish, then, I got this ghost. He said. No, no. That is not ghost. That
is Mahaprabhu. No, this is not Mahaprabhu. You know. I have seen Mahaprabhu.
This is completely different. So, what has happened was, actually, Caitanya
Mahaprabhu's whole body, you know, bodily limbs had become changed completely.
You know, how, what has happened was, now, he was not only having his spiritual
perception, he would, he was also having a participation in the spiritual
pastimes. And that participation was not just having some small effect in terms
of say, some of drained digestion. Or finger burning. But actually, the whole
joints have become disjointed. You know, it is some, what would happen is,
sometimes, you know, at one particular time, Caitanya Mahaprabhu had, became like
kūrmaḥ avatar. You know, kūr..., like a:

        kūrmo ’ṅgānīva sarvaśaḥ

Krishna says in 2.59..., 2.58. All the limbs of his body had become withdrawn
into the body completely. Completely withdrawn. And he had become very small.
Another time, he became huge. You know. Caitanya Mahaprabhu himself was already
tall and majestic. And each of his joints was separate from his joints for
several inches. And his arms appeared long. His legs appeared long. And what was
holding the limbs together was practically the skin. The joints had become
disjointed. And then, the devotees would be mortified. Frightened. To see such
transformations in Caitanya Mahaprabhu's f..., and then, they would beg Caitanya
Maha..., you know, they would pray. A..., nothing would happen. Finally, when
they would chant, they would chant the holy names. Then, actually, what would
happen is, Caitanya Mahaprabhu would come back to his consciousness. So, like
this, there are ma..., extraordinary pastimes. Now, these are the mystical
visions that can come. Bhaktivinoda Thakur would talk about Sahaja Samadhi.
Sahaja Samadhi means, you know, there is by the pri..., purification and the
elevation of our consciousness, there will be natural spiritual cognition that
will come. And Srila Prabhupada, also, there are times, when, you know, one
time, when he was in Sou..., you know, South America. And he was doing kirtan.
At that time, he, it was, he used to see, here, it comes automatic. And he
saw devo..., already at time, center over there. Gaura Nitai over there. And
devotees chanting and dancing. And they have become overwhelmed. And then, he
went into ecstasy. That was a, there was quite a few occasions. Not many. Srila
Prabhupada would normally try to stay at our level of consciousness. So that he
could, you know, instruct us. But sometimes, this ecstasy would take him to
higher levels of consciousness. So, this is the samadhi that awaits us. And this
samadhi is exhibited at its summit. Just as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu exhibits it,
similarly, the gopis of Vrindavan exhibit it. And not only the gopis of
Vrindavan exhibit it. But, you know, it is Radharani among them who exhibits it
the most. And we see this at its climax in chapters 46 and 47 of the Tenth Canto
of Srimad Bhagavatam. Where for this chapter, 46 is called as Brahmar Gita, the
song to the bumblebee. So, when Uddhava has come from, m..., m..., come from
Vrin..., m..., to Vrindavan, from Mathura to give Krishna a m..., a, Krishna,
here to the gopis. So, at that time, a bumblebee comes along over there. And
Caitanya Maha..., and Sri Cai..., Srimati Radharani sees that bumblebee and
treats it as a messenger of Krishna. She wants to speak to Uddhava. But Uddhava
is a ksatriya. Uddhava is a man. And, you know, it is not appropriate for
Radharani to chastise Uddhava. So, then, whatever her feelings are towards
Krishna. And towards Krishna's messenger, she starts speaking them towards
Uddhava. And it is just, and the way she speaks. It is a very elevated subject.
Which we cannot go into right now. But she speaks her heart out. And she is,
just, you know, frenzy of emotion. She says, you know, you are an unreliable
servant of unreliable master. I do not want to hear anything from you. Go away.
