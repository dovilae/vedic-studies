Hare Krishna. Welcome back to the Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We
completed the third chapter, in the previous class. Now, we are moving on to the
fourth chapter. So, the fourth chapter, themes with the concept a, of spiritual
knowledge. "Transcendental Knowledge" as Prabhupada calls it. The standard Gita
press, Gita called this, this chapter as a jnana-karma-sannyasa yoga. So, Third
Chapter is karma yoga. Fifth Chapter is karma-sannyasa yoga. And the chapter
in-between is titled as jnana-karma-sannyasa yoga. Srila Prabhupada translates
it as transcendental knowledge. As we have discussed, different acharyas titled
it in different ways. So, if we look at the theme, the theme is centered on
knowledge. We will see later on:

        na hi jñānena sadṛśaṁ
        pavitram iha vidyate

You know, the most important verse is in this chapter, is 3.38, 4.38. He says
nothing as pure as transcendental knowledge. And that is the means to Supreme
Happiness. That is why:

        tat svayam yoga-samsiddhah
        kalenatmani vindati

When we delight by that. So, let us start with the overview of this chapter. So,
the overview is based on, the five sections in the chapter. So, which, verses
one to ten talk about how Krishna teaches and establishes dharma. So, Krishna
teaches and establishes dharma. So, what is, you know, you know, this got to do
with the previous chapter? Previous chapter ended, we will discuss when we come
to the verses. But the essential point is that dharma is the means by which one
stays protected from kama. And becomes elevated. So, Krishna teaches that part.
Now, dharma involves many parts. So, 11 to 15 makes the point that Krishna is
the goal and the creator of all paths. Whatever parts are there, it is Krishna
who is the, who has made those paths. And it is thr..., through Krishna that all
parts are meant to born. And then, what is the dharma that Krishna is
recommending for Arjuna? There are many dharmas. So, karma-yoga is the dharma
which Krishna is recommending to Arjuna. And, you know, wha..., how does
karma-yoga bring about liberation? Because karma-yoga involves jnana, also. One
has knowledge. And by acting in knowledge, one attains liberation. So, in the
next chapter, next section of this chapter, 25 to 33, talks about achieving jnana
through sacrifices. So, by doing fire, various kinds of sacrifices. Not just
fire sacrifices, one can eventually come to jnana. You know, and then, th..., a,
what is the glory of that jnana is talked about in the last section, from 34 to
42. So, there are 42 verses in this chapter. The third chapter had 43 verses.
So, let us look at the verses. Beginning with the first verse.

        śrī-bhagavān uvāca

        imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ
        proktavān aham avyayam
        vivasvān manave prāha
        manur ikṣvākave ’bravīt

So, "imaṁ". This. This, we, first word. This knowledge. "yogaṁ". As I said. This
knowledge of yoga. Knowledge of one's relationship with the Supreme Lord.
"vivasvate". I spoke to Vivasvan. And then, "proktavan aham avyayam". I p...,
spoke it long ago. "proktavan". "avyayam" refers to imperishable. This
knowledge is, it is imperishable. It is very important knowledge. It lasts
forever. And "vivasvān manave prāha". "Vivasvān" spoke to Manu. And "manur
ikṣvākave ’bravīt". And Manu spoke it to Ikṣvāku. "’bravīt". "prāha" and
"bravīt" are synonyms of "proktavan". It all meaning spoke. So, now, here, the
question may suddenly come up. You know, in the previous chapter, Krishna was
talking about how lust attacks, steals the intelligence, the senses and the
mind. And how lust has to be conquered by regulating the senses. And situated on
the spiritual platform. And suddenly, where is sun-god coming to the picture?
You know, sun-god is there. And Iksvaku is there. And then, all the de..., all
the descendants are there. Where is, all this come from suddenly? So, the point
is that the knowledge which Krishna has told Arjuna in the third chapter, that
knowledge is not something which Krishna has just spun out of his magic hat at
that particular time. You know, those magicians have ha..., magic hat and from
that, when they want, they just pop out a rabbit. So, of course, there is some,
you know, sley of hand over there. And actually, the rabbit is there. But they
make it up with ra..., as it is suddenly, there is coming out of nowhere. So,
Krishna is not just concocted this knowledge. Right now, for the sake of Arjuna.
He actually, you know, this knowledge is eternal. And Krishna eventually, it,
also, in 3.31:

        ye me matam idaṁ nityam

These words are eternal words. So, Krishna is now explaining how these words are
eternal. He is saying that, actually, since from the beginning of creation, this
knowledge has been there. So, the knowledge of conquering lust is required for
all living beings. Because lust is the, always there among all living beings
right from the beginning. So, everybody has to fight and conquer lust. And how
do they fight and conquer? By the power of bhakti. By, ulti..., by the power of
jnana as we will describe in this chapter. And that jnana will ultimately
fructify at its highest level in bhakti. So, A..., Krishna is telling the, how
this knowledge has been coming down since time immemorial. And that is, so,
there, if it was "nityam". Here, it is "avyayam". So, it is similar. 3.31 and
4.1. So, it is coming down. And Krishna is giving a, a lineage by which it is
coming down. Now, Srila Prabhupada's purport is a little technical. So, we will
focus on some other aspects of it first. So, now, Prabhupada gives a very
interesting point. What is the duty of the king?

"The kings of all planets are especially meant for the protection of the
inhabitants,"

And now, we normally think of protection means, ok, there are terrorists. There
are thieves. We have to protect from them. But Prabhupada immediately clarifies:

"and therefore the royal order should understand the science of Bhagavad-gita in
order to be able to rule the citizens and protect them from material bondage to
lust."

So, that is the point. Connection between this and the last chapter is that they
are meant to protect their citizens from bondage to lust. Now, how does this
bondage to lust happen? That has been described in the previous chapter. And the
liberation from that bondage is not just the responsibility of the invidiual
citizens. No doubt. It is a responsibility of the citizens. But along with that,
it is also the responsibility of the kings. So, kings have to create a
socio-cultural environment by which people do not become bound to lust. That is
why Krishna is saying, I give this knowledge to the kings. And Prabhupada
further makes the point that:

"the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of Kṛṣṇa
consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science and
pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life."

So, in general, for any system of, you know, s..., you know, you know, spiritual
advancement to be socially effective, there has to be the union, the joining of
the brahmanas and ksatriyas. If we look at buddhism. Now, buddhism was the
religion of renunciates. Buddha himself renounced the world. And those who
followed him also renounced the world. And buddhism did not have much influence
o..., socially, till it was adopted by a king. You know, it was Ashoka. And once
Ashoka adopted it, you know, after that, he, you know, he, his whole family
adopted, his whole kingdom adopted it. And he practically became a missionary of
buddhism. He sent his son to Sri Lanka. And he sent his other family members,
different places. And that way, they all joined in spreading buddhism. So, that
is how buddhism spread. Similarly, if we see, you know, Christianity, for the
first three-four centuries, it was the prosecuted, persecuted religion by the,
persecuted by the Romans. And then, after that, it took off. And when it took
off, it took off very r..., fast, very powerfully. Once the Roman emperor
accepted Christianity. So, like that, if we look at, even in the Vedic culture,
we see the points that the brahmanas, ksatriyas would be united. And when they
would be united, the spiritual culture would go on very well. So, we see in
recent time, Sri Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, you know, he went to Puri. And he, you
know, was the person who transformed the heart of Prataparudra. Prataparudra
already had a, appreciation for Vaishnava culture. But the way he got captivated
by Sri Chaitanya Mahāprabhu's sweetness, and love, and mercy. Then, he offered
all the state resources for the protection and propagation o..., of Chaitanya
Mahāprabhu's mission. So, like that, in general, for any, you know, f..., esteem
of thought to become socially or culturally influential, there has to be the
joining of the brahmana and the ksatriya. In modern times, we see that, there
were Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. They wrote their book "Das Kapital". That
was The Co..., a, Communist Manifesto. Now, they were in, they were in their
own wiz..., intellectuals. You know, when they wrote their book. That aff..,
influenced some people. But eventually, communism came, you know, communism came
very influential f..., through Lenin and Stalin. When there was the revolution,
1917. When the Russian tsar was overthrown. And communist came to power. So,
after that, communism had a whole 1917 to almost the end of 1980s in the Russia.
For 70 years. So, in general, any system of thought for it to be socially
influential. Whether it is a, you know, it i..., it is a spiritual system of
thought or whether it is an atheistic system of thought. That requires the
joining of the intellectual and the administrator. So, th..., here, Krishna is
telling over here that I give this knowledge to the kings. So, why He is saying
He gives to the kings? Because the kings will influence society. The kings will
influence society. If the kings are materialistic, then people in general will
be influenced materialistically. If the kings are spiritually minded, then that
will influence the general public in a spiritual way. So, Krishna does not give
knowledge to anyone and everyone. Of course, this spiritual knowledge is
available for anyone and everyone. If they seek it. But Krishna will focus on
primarily giving knowledge to the kings. So, similarly, in our outreach, you
know, we would like to give spiritual knowledge to everyone. At the same time,
you know, if we have to concentrate our efforts, we will concentrate our efforts
on people who are socially influential. We say, Srila Prabhupada would be very
pleased when his disciples would bring leaders of society to meet him. So, there
are many conversations of Prabhupada with v..., various prominent thinkers. You
know, wherever he visited. So, the purpose of this is, Srila Prabhupada wanted
to influence those who are influencing society. And if that could happen, that
would influence a lot of people in a mass way. You know, this is not
discrimination. This is simply, you know, precision. What is the differen...,
difference between discrimination and precision? Discrimination means we reject
certain people. And no, you are not allowed. That is not the point. You know,
Prabhupada even went to the hippies. And he invited the hippies to start
practicing Krishna Consciousness. That, this was so extraordinary, Prabhupada
was a con..., was from the external point of view, conservative swami who would
not eat meat or even smoke. And he was wearing a traditional Indian attire. And
he was saying, whatever you are, whoever you are doing, Kri..., just chant Hare
Krishna.

So, at that time, when Srila Prabhupada came to San Francisco, like the people
put a headline. Swami Invites the Happy Hippies. So, it was quite radical for
such a conservative seeming Swami to in..., to invite people who were
considered, a, degraded even by western standards. What to speak of Vedic
standards? So, Prabhupada in that sense was ready to invite everyone to practice
Krishna Consciousness. At the same time, Prabhupada was f..., intending to focus
on certain people. So, in the first edition of the Bhagavad Gita. That was
preq..., req..., printed by Macmillan. You know, Allen Ginsberg's foreword was
there. Foreword is what comes at the beginning of a book to introduce that book
to its potential readers. But then, when Srila Prabhupada wanted to print the
book again, at that time, when BBT, you know, that time, it was ISKCON Press.
Then, it became Bhaktivedanta Book Trust. So, when the IR published the book,
Prabhupada has said, there is no need for Allen Ginsberg's foreword. Because
Allen Ginsberg, although he was famous, he was also controversial, you know, we
could say, he was a scandalist person. Because he openly advocated drugs. And he
also advocated, you know, f..., you know, free sex in many ways. You know, so,
he was not a respectab..., he was a famous person, but is not the social, in the
mainstream media and mainstream culture. He was not considered a very
respectable person. So, initially, when nobody was coming, whoever was coming,
Srila Prabhupada was happy. 15:15
