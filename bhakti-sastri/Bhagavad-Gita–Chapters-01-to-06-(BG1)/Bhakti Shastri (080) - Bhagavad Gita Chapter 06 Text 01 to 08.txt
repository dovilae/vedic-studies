Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. Now, we
go onto the Sixth Chapter. The Fifth Chapter ended with, you know, description
of ashtanga-yoga in verses 27-28. And 29th was bhakti-yoga. So, ashtanga-yoga
will be described in Chapter Six. Let us have an overview of Chapter Six. It is
ca..., this chapter is called as "Dhyāna-yoga". So, yes. So, Chapter Six has 47
verses. And verses 1 to 9 talk about advancement in the stage of yoga, in the
process of yoga. From Aruruksha, that is the beginnng stage. To Arudha, that is
the advanced stage. So, Aruruksha is, if we envision a ladder, then Aruruksha is
one who starts climbing up the ladder. Arudha is one who is situated on the
ladder. Like we have a m..., radha rudha. One, the per..., the charioteer, who
is already situated on the chariot. The warrior who is situated on the chariot.
It is said that Lord Vishnu, when he travels, He is Garuda Arudha. He is
situated on Garuda. Arudha means to be seated properly. Aruruksha means one who
has started climbing. So, if y..., yoga is a ladder, one who has started
climbing the ladder. And who is moving towards in the uppering of ladder. So,
the first verse to ninth verse talks about, you know, the process that one needs
to go through by which one can renounce the world. In dhyana-yoga, one renounces
the world and focuses exclusively on meditation. But there is some preliminary
purification that is required for that. That is described in one to nine. Then,
ten to thirty describes progressively, how one will attain perfection when one
is, you know, practicing yoga. So, from practice to perfection in yoga. So, ten
to fifteen describes realisation of Brahman. Sixteen to Twenty-three describes
realisation of Paramatma. And twenty-four to thirty-two beci..., describes
realisation of Bhagavan. Now, hmm, after that, thirty-three to thirty-seven,
Arjuna raises a question that, you know, what if so, the, the mind is very
difficult to control. So, Krishna answers that. So, two verses are questions,
33-34. And 35-36 a..., are the, you know, answer, are the answer. And then,
after that, the last section is, you know, if the mind deviates the yogi, then
what is the destination of the yogi. Where does the yogi, deviated yogi, foreign
yogi go. So, that Krishna answers in a, you know, very thought provocing
section. And then, lastly, Krishna says that the topmost yogi is one who fixes
his mind on Krishna. That means, you know, after giving, going through this
elaborated analysis of the process of bhakti-yoga. Krishna eventually comes to
talking, o..., of, after going through the elaborated analysis of ashtanga-yoga.
Krishna eventually comes to the conclusion that bhakti-yoga is the best,
bhakti-yoga is the highest. So, that will set the scene for Krishna to start
speaking in the Seventh Chapter. When he will speak about bhakti-yoga. So, it
will, take, you know, this, this chapter takes us slowly up the yoga ladder
to the perfection of fixing the mind on Krishna. And the next chapter describes
in alternative way of attaining that same perfection. So, let us look at the
Sixth Chapter now. Beginning with verse one. So, the first section is, moving
from the Aruruksha stage to the Arudha stage. So:

        śrī-bhagavān uvāca

        anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ
        kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ
        sa sannyāsī ca yogī ca
        na niragnir na cākriyaḥ

So, "anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ". So, one does the work without taking ashraya of
the "phalaṁ". In this world, when people want to work, you know, and they need
motiva..., motivation for the work. So, what is the motivation? The motivation
is the fruit. And they take ashraya of the fruit. That means, suppo..., suppose,
there is a sports champion. You know, There is a world cup cricket team, winning
cricket, world cup winning cricket team. And the captain is asked, you know,
what is, how did you win this world cup? What motivated you? He says, you know,
for, since my childhood, I was w..., w..., imagining myself. Holding up the
world cup in my hand. And at, that dream motivated me. So, what is happening
over here? "a...", this is "āśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ". One is taking shelter of the
fruit of work. Now, the Bhagavad Gita is not that against doing, you know, you
know, you know, things in this world. Now, it is not against achievements. But
if those outer achievements are, lawn our, our motivation, then we do not make
any inner development. You know, any spiritual development through that outer
achievement. We do not necessarily go closer to Krishna. So, therefore, a, a
person, when he wor..., a, when a d..., when a, especially, here, Krishna is
talking about a karma-yogi. Now, a p..., a pure devotee may visualise things to
be offered for Krishna's service. That is different. But the karma-yogi is
primarily focusing on detaching oneself from worldly things. So, therefore,
m..., the karma-yogi's motivation, as we discussed in 5.11 is ke...:

        kāyena manasā buddhyā
        kevalair indriyair api
        yoginaḥ karma kurvanti
        saṅgaṁ tyaktvātma-śuddhaye

So, "ātma-śuddhaye". The yogi works primarily for purification. Not for
"phalaṁ". So, Krishna is telling here, what a yogi has to do, in the beginning,
"anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ". And then, what does v..., "kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ"?
"kāryaṁ" means prescribed duty. Understanding this is my obligatory duty. "karma
karoti". "kāryaṁ". What, what is, I am obliged to do? I will do that. "sa
sannyāsī". Such a person is a sannyasi. S..., "sa", "yo...", "ca yogī ca". That
a person is the renunciate. And that person is also a yogi. So, it is
interesting, Krishna has suddenly m..., used the two words, sannyasa and yoga
together. Such a person is a sannyasi and yogi, also. If we remember in Thir...,
in the Fifth Chapter, Krishna has referred to sannyasi and yogi, as two
opposite. You know, two different paths, not necessarily opposite, but different
paths. And in Third Chapter, he has referred to them alm..., almost as opposite.
You know, so, in the Fifth Chapter, Krishna has talked about how:

        sannyāsas tu mahā-bāho
        duḥkham āptum ayogataḥ
        yoga-yukto munir brahma
        na cireṇādhigacchati

So, in 5.6, He has talked about sannyasa and yoga, as two opposite process...,
in as two distinct process. Not necessarily opposite, but distinct processes.
So, He has told our how both ultimately leads..., to s..., same destination. But
he says, one who tries to practice sannyasa alone. sanny..., with, without yoga,
such a person, what happens to such a person? "duḥkham āptum ayogataḥ". On the
other hand, one who practices yoga, "yoga-yukto munir brahma". "na
cireṇādhigacchati". Not after a long time. Soon, such a person will attain
perfection. So, in that sense, Krishna, many, what he has talked about is two
different persons. And now, He is saying, essentially, they are the same. So,
"sa sannyāsī ca yogī ca". So, who is the yogi? Who is such a person? What, what
a sannyasi? And a yogi? So, normally, Krishna has used the word yogi till now to
u..., refer to karma-yoga. Hmm. Although, we may use the word yogi, generally, we
think of a person who does a, yoga asanas. And generally, when the word yoga is
used alone, most people think of the yoga-marga. The ashtan..., the process of
ashtanga yoga. But Krishna, till now, has not talked about ashtanga-yoga much.
And whenever he has used the word yoga, he has used it in terms of connection
with one's prescribed duty. And, and of course, through the connection, with
one's prescribed duty, one, you know, connects with the Absolute Truth. But
Krishna is here saying that, both are similar. That sannyasa means
disconnection, you know, from the material world. And yoga is connection with
the Absolute Truth. That can be o..., by various ways. One way is by doing one's
work. So, then, such a person is a sannyasi and a yogi. Krishna will ex...,
clarify it, how the person is the same. How sannyasi and yogi can be the same
person. Krishna will clarify in the next verse. But here, he is saying, "na
niragnir na cākriyaḥ". So, such a, who, who is sannyasi? That person who works.
Not the person who does not work. And not working, Krishna talks in two terms
here. "na". "na cākriyaḥ". The person who does not do "kriyaḥ". Such a person is
not, therein, a, a n..., not the actual yogi, or the sannyasi. And among the
various "kriyaḥ"s, among the various prescribed duties that are done, a
prominent prescribed duty for a person who is a grihasta, who is living in the
world is agni. That actually, they are meant to light the sacrificial fire. So,
of course, in Kali Yuga, we do not like the sacrificial fire. We chant the Hare
Krishna maha mantra. But either way, "na niragnir", actually, one is meant to do
a prescribed duty. That prescribed duty involves a lighting the fire. So that
yajnas can be performed. Krishna has talked in the Third Chapter about how, you
know, you know, yajna, one who does not do yajna:

        aghāyur indriyārāmo
        moghaṁ pārtha sa jīvati

So, yajna is important duty. And Krishna is telling, right in the beginning of
the Sixth Chapter that one should not give up yajna. That one should not, you
know, give up lighting the fire in the name of renunciation. So, m...,
Prabhupada explains in the purport, that actu..., you know, he explains now from
a devotional perspective that, hmmm:

"The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of
the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the
complete whole. Similarly, the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the
supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect sannyāsī, the
perfect yogī."

So, how, so, the yogi, because, how is such a person yogi? Because a y..., yogi
is connected with the complete whole. So, the, so the person, the living entity
who is acting with satisfaction, supreme whole, is, in that sense, a yogi. And
how is the living entity sannyasi? Because he is free from selfish desire. So,
freedom from selfish desire, sannyasa. And the desire for self this, service to
the Absolute Truth, that is yoga. And that is how the person is sannyasi as well
as yogi. And then, Prabhupada i..., quotes about how the perfect sannyasi,
perfect yogi. He gives the example of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu quoting
Shikshashtakam. So, he said, Lord Caitanya, Prabhupada refers to, as:

"the highest perfectional symbol of renunciation"

So, highest perfectional symbol of renunciation. So, Caitanya Mahaprabhu was so
renounced. You know, he was the example. It is, says that, "chudamani", He is
the jewel among renunciates. So, he, this, talks about his consciousness.

        na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ
        kavitāṁ vā jagad-īśa kāmaye
        mama janmani janmanīśvare
        bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi

So, "na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ". These are actually what people in general
aspire for. People want wealth. They want followers. They want, you know, the
enjoyable association of the opposite sex. You know, enjoyable assocation,
attractive members of the opposite sex. Basically, sexual pleasure. And then,
"kavitāṁ". "kavitāṁ" refers to, "vā jagad-īśa kāmaye". "kavitāṁ vā" v..., refer
to the fame, a, praise, a, learning. Various things it can refer to. There are
things which people want. This is what people define as success. So, but
Kr..., Caitanya Mahaprabhu say..., I do not want any of these things. So,
extraordinary prayer of devotion. So, in one sense, the first part of this verse
is talking about sannyasa. I do not want, want any of these thing..., "kavitāṁ
vā jagad-īśa kāmaye". So, when I do not want all these things, then what do I
want? So, here, sannyasa means rejection. And then, yoga means connection. So,
Krishna, Caitanya Mahaprabhu is saying that as I do sannyasa of all these
things, I do not want sannyasa. But what is the connection that I want? That I
want to be always connected to you in devotion. "mama janmani janmanīśvare".
Even if I have to go through many lifetimes. "bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi".
I want to be fixed in devotion. And what kind of devotion? "ahaitukī".
Unmotivated devotion. That means this connection with the cr..., with the Lord,
I do not want to be, to be conditional. Because the Lord does this for me. So, I
do, I, you know, become devoted to him. So, "ahaitukī". You know, without any
cause. It is selfless. Pure. So, this is the example of "sa sannyāsī ca yogī
ca". One who is disconnected from the world and connected with the Absolute
Truth. Now, you know, hmm, Krishna will explain this point of "sa sannyāsī ca
yogī ca", in the next verse.

        yaṁ sannyāsam iti prāhur
        yogaṁ taṁ viddhi pāṇḍava
        na hy asannyasta-saṅkalpo
        yogī bhavati kaścana

So, "yaṁ sannyāsam iti prāhur". That which is known as sannyasa. That is also
known as yoga. "yogaṁ taṁ viddhi". Oh, Pāṇḍava, oh, Arjuna, know that is also
yoga. So, Krishna is saying that actually, they are the same. So, what he has
talked about in the Fifth Chapter as similarity in destination. Now, Krishna is
saying, there is similarity in content, also. How? "na hy asannyasta-saṅkalpo".
That actually, if one does not give up "saṅkalpaḥ". "saṅkalpaḥ" is desire.
Desire for worldly enjoyment. And "asannyasta" means without giving it up. So,
unless one gives up the desire for worldly enjoyment, one cannot be a yogi.
"yogī bhavati kaścana". One cannot be a yogi unless one gives up the desire for
worldly enjoyment. So, Krishna is telling over here that, you know, how our yoga
and ka..., sannyasa are, sa..., how is kar..., ny..., same. That both are, that
actually, they cannot be yoga. Authentic yoga. There cannot be genuine
connection with the Lord unless there is disconnection with the enjoyments that
connect a, take us away from the Lord. You know, just like, if we want to say
that, you know, in, we want to light a fire. And we want to, you know, remove
the darkness. So, actually, you know, you know, we cannot remove darkness unless
we light fire. And when we light fire, darkness automatically goes away. So, the
two are connected. So, similarly, when there is, there is, you know, when there
is two..., when there is sannyasa, there will be yog..., you know, that when
there has to be yoga, sannyasa has to be there. If there is no sannyasa. And
there is not much, yo..., yo..., real yoga happening. So, if people are claiming
to practice spiritual life. Prabhupada says this in the, one of the Second Canto
purports. That if a person is chanting Hare Krishna, but is still engaged in all
kinds of sensory activities, is engaged in all kinds of sen..., sensory,
looking, especially immoral sinful sense gratification. Then, that person is not
actually genuine devotee. That person's, a, devotion is ex..., pseudo-devotion.
Of course, chanting is good. It will help. You know. But if we are chanting
sincerely that, K..., we should lead to detachment. It may take a little time
for different people. The amount of time may differ for different people. But
still, you know, there will be progression in that direction. So, now,
Prabhupada, a, now, he uses this word, real sannyasa-yoga. So, now, Prabhupada
combines the two words, as a compound word, sannyasa-yoga. So, sannyasa is
disconnection from the world. Yoga is connection with the word. And he says "or
bhakti". So, he equates sannyasa-yoga with bhakti. And he says that, you know,
we, this means, we simply act according to our constitutional position. And, and
Prabhupada points to this, how these two are combined.

"The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selﬁsh satisfaction and to
be prepared to satisfy the Supreme."

That means we work, you know, not for our pleasure, but for Krishna's pleasures.
Krishna's pleasures. So, in that way, sannyasa and yoga become combined
together. Now, Krishna will elaborate on this theme of "sannyasta-saṅkalpo" in
the next verse. Next two verses. So, He, before He elaborates, He gives the,
some technical terminology over here. You know, so, let us look at this
terminology.

        ārurukṣor muner yogaṁ
        karma kāraṇam ucyate

So, "ārurukṣor". "ārurukṣor" means, as I said, one who is just beginning to
climb. "muner yogaṁ". So, when one is in the beginning stages, in the process of
yoga, at that time. "karma kāraṇam ucyate". "karma" is the cause. The, it is the
cause of what? Cause of one's s..., progress. It is the cause of one's spiritual
advancement. And then one, when, is advanced in yoga, "ārūḍha". "yogārūḍha" is
at the same. And then, what is the, you know, what is the cause? "śamaḥ kāraṇam
ucyate". "śamaḥ" is inactivity. Pacification. Calmness. "cessation" of
activities as Prabhupada translates it. "kāraṇam ucyate". That means, now,
Krishna is telling that yes, there is a stage when one has to renounce activity.
But that is an advanced stage. And He is giving a structure. He says, first, in
the "ārurukṣoḥ" stage, work itself will lead to advancement. And then, when the
"yogārūḍha" stage, you know, the, a, cessation of work will lead to advan...,
you know, lead to advan..., will lead to advancement. So, Prabhupada says, the,
hmm, hmm, m..., here, the yama, niyama, asana, what are all they meant to do?

"All such activities lead to achieving perfect mental equilibrium to control the
senses. When one is accomplished the practice of meditation, he ceases all
disturbing mental activities."

And, so, the point is, first that we regulate our physical activities through
yama, niyama, asana, pranayama. And vi..., yama, niyama, asana, pranayama can be
practiced even while one is in the world and doing activities in the world. But
once one goes to the level of pratyahara. "pratyahara" means setting out the
sense objects. Then, one cannot stay in the world. Then, one renounces the
world. And one n..., focuses on turning inwards. And then, there is dha...,
dharana, dhyana, samadhi. There are these other progressive stages in which one
goes inwards and inwards. And ultimately perceives the Supersoul in the heart.
So, the initial stages, initial four stages, one, when one can actually
practice, you know, you know, you know, doing karma, also. Doing karma-yoga.
These are the kar..., la..., Aruduksha stage. So, yama, niyama, asana,
pranayama, they are the Aruruksha stage. And the next four involve a person
rising to the Arudha stage. So, hmm, so, here, let us understand what is going
on once again now. So, in six, you know, in 6.1, Krishna's focus is on the
person. And 6.2, focus is on the path. So, what is the focus on the person? Same
person, Krishna is saying, sannyasi and yogi. And the point is, "anāśritaḥ
karma-phalaṁ". 20:02
