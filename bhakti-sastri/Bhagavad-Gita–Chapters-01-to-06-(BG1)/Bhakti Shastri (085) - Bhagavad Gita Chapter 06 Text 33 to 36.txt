Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are
now in the Sixth Chapter. Where we are studying the concerns of Arjuna about
practicing ashtanga-yoga. So, we discussed several verses. Yesterday, about
progressive realisations. Let us have a quickly, recap of those verses. And
their thought flow. Yes. So, in the progressive realisation of the Absolute
Truth. The verses 27 and 28 talk about Brahman realisation. M..., then verse 29
talks about Paramatma realisation. Verse 30 to 31 talks about Bhagavan
realisation. So, 27-28, a, 27-28 talking:

        sukhena brahma-saṁsparśam
        atyantaṁ sukham aśnute

Then, 29 talk about:

        sarva-bhūta-stham ātmānaṁ

That all living beings are situated at the spiritual level. And 30 and 31, the
word "māṁ" comes very clearly.

        yo māṁ paśyati sarvatra

And:

        sarva-bhūta-sthitaṁ yo māṁ
        bhajaty ekatvam āsthitaḥ

So, in both cases, the "māṁ" is coming with, explicitly. And that is why we can
understand that this is referring to the Bhagavan realisation. And then, 32
gives the conclusion that one should see all living beings equally based on
their spiritual, you know, equality as parts of Krishna. As, you know,
absolu..., as a, particles of the Absolute Truth depending on the, you know,
what is the level of realisation of the yogi. Now, one thing we have to
understand here, when we say this verse refers to Brahman realisation. This
refers to Paramatma realisation. This refers to Bhagavan realisation. Actually,
you know, the names, Brahman, Paramatma, and Bhagavan, they are used
interchangeably within the Vedic literature. This is an important concept to
understand. That there is, h..., there are names. Or there are terms. And there
are concepts. So, just like in the Bhagavatam, we will see that in the
beginning, it says, Krishna is the source of all incarnations. In one, you know,
in the Third Can..., a, Chapter of the First Canto.

        kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam

That makes it clear over there. But afterwards, the Bhagavatam uses the terms
Krishna and Vishnu interchangeably. So, even in the pastime of Prahlad Maharaja,
the name Krishna may come. Krishna g..., griha..., grihastatma. And, a, there,
Vishnu name also come. And eventually, Nrsimhadeva may appear. Nrsimhadeva
appears. So, after giving a technical classification of the terms. Then, it is
not that the Bhagavatam, because it involves multiple speakers, multiple
context, multiple threads of conversation. The terms may not always be used in
the same technical sense everywhere. So, in one sense, we have a technical
differentiation between Krishna and m..., m..., Vishnu. Krishna is the source of
all incarnations. But then, after making that one point, the Bhagavatam for all
practical purposes uses the terms interchangeably. So, even the Rasa
Panchadhyayi section, the term Krishna, you know, Govinda. These are the terms
which are used. Names which are used. But then, at the end, Vishnu is used. So,
the point here is that these n..., we should understand that con..., names,
c..., the terms and concepts. You know. So, concepts are intellectual terms are
verbal. And they are both tools for comprehension. So, they are what? Tools for
comprehension. Tools for gaining a deeper understanding. Now, when we use terms.
And we use concepts. We are all trying to gain an understanding of the deeper
Absolute Truth. And, you know, these terms may not always be used, you know, in
the same sense. And as at all times. Just like, you know, when Krishna may be
used to refer to Vishnu. And Vishnu may be used to refer to Krishna. Although,
there is a technical differentiation, in a normal conversation sense, it is not
that the technical differentiation will always be s..., a, always be adhered to.
So, similaly, when the words Brahman, Paramatma, and Bhagavan are used,
sometimes, the word Brahman may also be used to refer to the Absolute Truth in
the personal aspect. And, you know, the word Paramatma may also be used to refer
to the Absolute Truth in the personal aspect. Krishna may be referred to as
Brahm..., Paramatma. Krishna may be referred to as Brahma. We see Vishnu
Sahasranama. It is not that Vishnu is always be referred to as Bhagavan, only.
Vishnu may be used to refer to as Brahma, also. As Paramatma, also. So, the
point is, we have to, you know, with, when we want to look at the meanings of
words, we have to understand the broad philosophy and the specific context. And
then, we can understand what this word refers to. So, we have to understand,
first the overall philosophical message. What is the message? And then, we have
to look at the specific context. And then, we understand. Ok. This is the term
that is used. And in this term, in this context, this term means this. The
scriptures have to be understood always in context. The text and the context are
integrally related. If we separate the two, then we will not get proper
understanding. So, text and context have to be brought together. Now, Brahman.
Paramatma. Bhagavan. These are progressive levels of realisation. You know. You
know. We understand this from the understanding of what the word Brahman means.
What the word Paramatma means. So, Brahman means all-pervasive, pervading. You
know. Non-personal effulgence of the Absolute Truth. Then, m..., m..., Paramatma
refers to the localised, you know, m..., m..., localised manifestation of the
Absolute Truth. And Bhagavan refers to the all-attractive transcendental person.
All three are transcendental. All three are spiritual. And this is the te..., a,
when one pursues a particular level. Then, one is at a Brahman level. When one
perceives the next level, one is at Paramatma level. One pursues the complete
Absolute Truth, that is the Bhagavan level.

So, in these verses 28, you know, 27-28, which talks about Brahman. 29 talks
about Paramatma. 30-31 talks about Bhagavan. The point is that the yogi is
moving higher and higher in spiritual realisation. So, these verses can be
interpreted differently. And different acharyas will interpret in different ways
to, you know, develop the flow of thought. So, this is one way of looking at it.
Where we understand the progression systematically. Now, m..., when we talk
about different acharyas interpreting things differently. The point is that
Krishna's words can have unlimited import. Unlimited does not mean that any
and every import is right. Krishna's words have unlimited import. But
ultimately, Krishna's message has a conclusion. And whatever import is in
con..., consistency with that conclusion, we can use that. But whatever import
is not in consistency with that conclusion, that import will not be usable,
acceptable. Now, so, unlimited does not mean that, you know, even the mayavadis'
inpet..., interpretations are right. The interpretations have to be consistent
with the overall philosophical message. But once it is consistent, the words can
have different meanings. So, we are looking at a particular flow of thought.
Which is based on the acharyas' commentaries. No doubt. But, you know, as a, the
acharyas have different context. And they give different meanings. So, I do not
quote in my classes here. I am planning to write a book, eventually, where we
will talk more critically. More systematically. In the classes, we are thinking,
you know, the, we are c..., trying to get an overall understanding. Without
going too much into technical integrities. So, we are analysing a flow which
helps us to understand how the Bhagavad Gita's thought is evolving. So, Brahman.
Paramatma. And Bhagavan. The yogi moves forward. Higher. Higher. In the
realisations. Hmm. Hmm. So, so, the word "sama-darśanaḥ". As I mentioned, it was
used in 5.18. And it is used again in 6.29. So, "darśan" refers to direct sight.
Or it can refer to philosophical insight. It has both meanings. You know. When
we use the word "darśan". For, when we go and take "darśan" of the deities. That
time, we are referring to, h..., m..., direct sight. But it can also refer to
philosophical insight. When we, h..., actually take, a, when there are six
philosophical system. "ṣaḍdarśana", as they are called. So, philosophy is meant
to give us insight. So, i..., "darśan" can refer to both. And here, the word
"sama-darśanaḥ". That is used. Can result fro..., a, that, "sama-darśanaḥ",
equal vision can result from seeing the Supersoul. Or the soul. Or both. So, in
5.18, both are there. And 6.29 talks primarily about the Supersoul. So, 5.18
was:

        vidyā-vinaya-sampanne

That was the verse. Well-known verse. And one can see the Supersoul. And the
Supersoul. And, thereby, see with equal vision. The 6.29, it is primarily vision
of Supersoul that is there. Hmm. So, then, after that, now, 6.29, some peop...:

        sarva-bhūta-stham ātmānaṁ
        sarva-bhūtāni cātmani

You know. Does it support mayavada? Oh, the, one sees the Absolute Truth
everywhere. Actually, mayavada is much mo..., mayavada's propositions are much
more insidious than just a non-pers..., just a sense of oneness. A devotee also
has sense of oneness. What characterises mayavada is not just sense of oneness.
But also the sense that everything else is illusion. That there is only Brahman.
And tattva-traya. The jiva. Jagat. And Jagadish. All three are illusion. That is
the proposition of mayavada. That is offensive proposition. That is definitely
not supported by the Bhagavad Gita. Hmm. So, now, you know, let us look at where
all Krishna has been talked about, m..., in the Bhagavad Gita. So, there is a
lot over here. Till now, where all has Krishna come? Krishna has come, the
mention of Krishna has self-reference. "māṁ". Where all has it come in the
Bhagavad Gita? In the Sixth Chapter. In dhyana-yoga. In 6.14 and 15, it has
come.

        ... mac-citto
        yukta āsī...

        manaḥ saṁyamya mac-citto
        yukta āsīta mat-paraḥ

This came in 6.14. So, there, it can refer to Krishna as the object of
meditation. It does not have to be the goal of meditation. What is the
difference between object and goal? What is the difference between object and
goal? You know. A student may have a ph..., you know, physics as the object of
study. But the goal of study is not physics. The goal of study is, maybe, the
student wants to go to America. And in America, the student wants to be
prosperous. Be famous. You know, know, get a lucrative job. So, that, physics
may not be the object of interest, primarily. The object of interest is, just,
you know, you know, money and fame. And physics is a tool to that. So, in the
process of yoga, the yogi can have two attitudes towards Krishna. One attitude
is that, Krishna is the Absolute Truth who is my goal. And the other is, Krishna
is the object of meditation. And eventually, by using this object of meditation,
I will get a hi..., go to a higher reality. So, it is not necessary. And:

        mat-saṁsthām adhigacchati

is talked about in 6.15. You know. 6.15 is:

        mat-saṁsthām adhigacchati

A..., so, attains my abode. Attains my position. That is the spiritual sky that
is talked about over there. Now, in 6.30, Krishna talks about:

        yo māṁ paśyati sarvatra
        sarvaṁ ca mayi paśyati

One who sees Me everywhere. And sees everything in Me. This is the culmination
of dhyana-yoga. So, ultimately, dhyana-yoga leads to samadhi. So, of course,
Srila Prabhupada, when he was correlating dhyana-yoga with, you know,
bhakti-yoga. He would generally quote 6.47. Which is very categorical. Among all
yogis, bhakti-yoga is th..., yoga is the highest. One who thinks about Me, that
is bhakti-yoga, is highest. So:

        yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
        mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā

That is 6.47. We will come to later. But here, the point is, there is
culmination of dhyana-yoga. When Krishna is within that progression, He is
leading to bhakti-yoga. And, you know, then, after that, hmm, the significance
of 6.7..., 31 if you have to see, 6.29 says, sees all beings in the atma. 6.30
says, sees all beings in Me. That yogi. And then, the all-pervading one is equal
to me. So, the, who, seer is the yogi who is always situated in Me. That means,
what Krishna is telling that the person who is having the vision of 29 and the
vision of 30, they are the same. As first, we see all-pervading being as atma.
Here, atma refers to the Brahm..., Paramatma. You know. The, and then, He says
the Paramatma and I are the same. So, there is a progressive, progression over
here. Now, let us go to Arjuna's question. So, Arjuna is going to ask here.
M..., "yo ’yaṁ yogas tvayā proktaḥ". So:

        arjuna uvāca

        yo ’yaṁ yogas tvayā proktaḥ
        sāmyena madhusūdana
        etasyāhaṁ na paśyāmi
        cañcalatvāt sthitiṁ sthirām

So, "yo ’yaṁ". What You have told me, oh, oh, Krishna, this system, "yo ’yaṁ
yogas tvayā proktaḥ". What you have talked about me, "sāmyena". So, it has f...,
it focused on "sāmyena". Or oneness of perception. So, Krishna had talked about
"sama-darśanaḥ".

        sarva-bhūta-sthitaṁ yo māṁ
        bhajaty ekatvam āsthitaḥ
        sarvathā vartamāno ’pi
        sa yogī mayi vartate

So, "sama". "sama" has come again and again. Equanimity. Equality of emotion and
perception. So, "etasyāhaṁ na paśyāmi". I do not see it. So, now, it is
interesting, Krishna uses the, Arjuna uses the word "paśyāmi". Krishna has used
the word "paśyāmi" just, you know, two verses earlier. This is 6.33. And three
verses earlier in 6.30. "yo māṁ paśyati sarvatra". I see everything. But Krishna
has used the same. Arjuna has used the same word. "etasyāhaṁ na paśyāmi". So,
Krishna is telling that, you are saying that I should be able to h..., have an
equal vision everywhere. So, I, I do not think it is possible for me. You know.
I cannot see like this. "etasyāhaṁ na paśyāmi". I cannot see everyone equally.
"cañcalatvāt sthitiṁ sthirām". "sthitiṁ sthirām". "cañcalatvāt". The mind is not
stable. It is not in a steady situation. It is in a restless situation.
"cañcalatvāt". It is constantly restless. So, now, Krishna is being told by
Arjuna, you are saying, I should see all living beings equally. But I do not
think I can see "Yudhiṣṭhira" and "Duryodhana" equally. I cannot see "Karṇa" and
"Bhīma" equally. I cannot see, m..., Shakuni and, you know, m..., people on my
side. I cannot see them equally. It is difficult. So, it is, it just seems
impractical to me. "yo ’yaṁ yogas tvayā proktaḥ". What You have spoken, so, we
see, Arjuna, you know, is expressing submission as well as, you know,
reservation. You know. Submission means I will do whatever you say. Reservation
means I cannot do what you say. So, we may say, how can both be there? Actually,
there is submission and reservation. Submission means yes, I am not saying what
you are saying is wrong. Say, when we say that, somebody, what somebody is
saying is wrong, that will be not, you know, that will be, you know, you know,
off..., that can be offensive. So, Kri..., Arjuna is not offensive. He is
submissive. He is expressing submission. Yes, what you are saying is ok. But it
is not practical for me. It is not possible for me. So, there is subm..., there
is submission. Yes. Oh, You have spoken this. But reservation is, I cannot do
this. So, it is interesting combination. Submission and reservation. And we see
this even in Dhruva Maharaja. When Narada Muni gives him two sets of
instructions. You know. F..., you know. Two levels. He is phase that you know,
i..., actually, a child, sometimes, you know, parents chastise the child. And
N..., Narada Muni tells this "Dhruva Maharaja ". You know. Sometimes, children
are in joking, also. They say this and that. And what happens within parents
and children is not to be taken too seriously. You could not a, a, just a small
thing. You could not sit on your father's lap. The next day, your father will
allow you to sit. And, you know, he says that, that is, child, children do not
take such things seriously. Children, sometimes, you know, when they quarrel,
sometimes, they say, "katti". You know. No. I am not going to talk with you. So,
when they say, I am not going to talk with you. And we will see, after three,
four days, all the children are playing together. Not just talking. But playing
happily together. So, he says, children do not take such things seriously. You
know. You know. What happens between children is not taken seriously. And he
says, if you think you are not a child. If you are grown-up. If truly grown-up.
Not just physically. But also spiritually. Then, you should know for such
people. You know. Honor and dishonor is the same. So, even if you are going
dishonored, do not bother about it. You know. Treat honor and dishonor equally.

So, when, n..., Narada Muni tries to test, a, g..., Dhruva by checkmating him.
You know. If you are at this level, still, you should not take it seriously. If
you are at this level, you should not take it seriously. Then, what does, you
know, Dhruva Maharaja say? He is not Maharaja at that time. He is just a small
child, Dhruva, at that time. Five years old. So, what does he say? He just, you
know, he submi..., he is, expresses submission. But he also expresses
reservation. He says yes. But actually, I am in an intermediate stage. You know.
Our ksatriya blood is running within me. And because that ksatriya blood is
running, you know, I cannot tolerate insult. So, you know, just accepting it is
not possible for me. I need a way to get kingdom. I need a way to show father
and others that I can get a kingdom bigger than this. You know. What to speak of
sitting on the throne, on the lap of my father who is sitting on a throne. I
want a throne for a kingdom which is bigger than my father's. I do not want to,
you know, actually, it is, my idea was that you sit on a throne. The father
sitting on the throne. And the son sit on the lap of the father. Even that was
not allowed for me. But what I want is, I will sit on an exclusive throne for a
kingdom which is bigger than my father's. In fact, not just my father, my whole
dynasty. That is the only way the feeling of insult, the feeling of dishonor
that is burning my insides will be resolved. So, please tell me a way by which I
can. So, he accepts that you are, what you are, instructions are true. But I am
not at that level to follow the instructions. So, you know, sometimes, when the,
we are told, when you are given instructions. Just follow the instructions. It
is a good attitude to aspire for. But whether we can do that. You know. It is
not that Prabhu..., you know, we have to always put aside our intelligence when
we are given instructions. If you feel that this is not practical for me. Then,
we have the right to accept our, exp..., express our reservations. Sometimes, we
may hear in some classes, some devotee say, everybody should chant 64 rounds
every day. Now, yes, it is a good aspiration to chant 64 rounds. But it may not
be practical all the time. So, we have to, you know, Arjuna expresses realistic
reservations over here. See, our aspiration is very lofty. We want to be pure
devotees of Krishna. Constantly absorbing the remembrance of Krishna. So, we
want to go towards that. But how do we go towards that? See, in spiritual life,
there are the stars. And there are the stairs. The stars are what we aspire to
be. Stairs are the steps that we take to go there. The stars and the stairs. So,
you know, if we just look at the stars, then do not look at the stairs. Then, we
will never move up. We will just, oh, it is so high level up there. That is, that
is not. We, and if you look only at the stairs, and do not look at the stars.
Then, we may not feel inspiration. Oh, I can get there, also, just by doing one
step at a time. One step at a time. One step. I can eventually get there. Then,
so, we need the stars and the stairs. So, here, Kr..., Arjuna is expressing, a
re..., submissive reservation. He says "etasyāhaṁ na paśyāmi". He says I cannot
see this practical for me. It is not practical for me. Because the mind is
restless. "cañcalatvāt sthitiṁ sthirām". "cañcala". "cañcala" is restless. And
then, he will elaborate on this. You know. So, Prabhupada explains in the
purport that at, it was difficult even for Arjuna.

Now, some people may argue. You know. Prabhupada say, a, Prabhupada wr...,
writes at various places that there is no record of Arjuna having practiced the
system of ashtanga-yoga. 21:04
