Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course, last
series. So, today, we will discuss the Fourth Chapter. We are concluding the
first section of the Fourth Chapter. And then, we will move on to the second
section. So, we discussed about ho..., why Krishna appears. So, at one level,
Krishna appears to give us, a, to teach dharma. And to establish order of a
real. Krishna teaches and establishes dharma. That was the first section. But
then, we discussed dharma does not mean just establishing order over here.
Dharma also means, He is setting up an order over here so that people can come
out of this material world and return back to Him. So, for that, one has to have
"tattvataḥ". Understanding of Krishna. So, now, let us move forward and look at
4.10. So, now, in 4.9, Krishna has said that the people who understand me in
truth will come back to me. Now, in this verse, after this, He explains, what
are the obstacles to understanding Him in truth. So, three obstacles, He
mentions. And Prabhupada elaborates them, profoundly in his purport. So, we
will look at those three obstacles. And then, once we become free from these
three obstacles, how we can attain the shelter of Krishna. That is what Krishna
tells.

        vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhā
        man-mayā mām upāśritāḥ
        bahavo jñāna-tapasā
        pūtā mad-bhāvam āgatāḥ

So, "vīta". "vīta" means to become free from. "rāga-bhaya-krodhā". "rāga" is
attachment. "bhaya" is fear. And "krodhā" is anger, born of frustration. Anger.
So, when a person becomes free from these three things. Then, "man-mayā". That
person can fix the mind on Me. "mām upāśritāḥ". They can, that person can take
shelter of Me. So, this is the first time in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna is using
the word "āśritāḥ" for "mām", "āśritāḥ". To take shelter of Me. This will come
again and again in the Gita. But it is the first reference. "mām āś...",
"upāśritāḥ". And then, what? "bahavo jñāna-tapasā". So, Krishna is telling that
this path, which I am telling you, you know, of taking she..., fixing the mind
on Me and taking shelter of Me. Actually, many people have done that in the
past. "bahavo" is many. "jñāna-tapasā". By the austerity of knowledge. "pūtā".
They have become purified. And "mad-bhāvam āgatāḥ". They have attained my
"bhāva". They have attained divine emotion for me. "bhāva" refers to emotion.
So, they have attained transcendental love for me. So, Krishna says,
"vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhā". So, the same phrase, "vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhā" had come
in the Second Chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. When Krishna was talking about
"sthita-prajña". You know, "sthi...", "sthita-prajña". "munir". So, He says:

        duḥkheṣv anudvigna-manāḥ
        sukheṣu vigata-spṛhaḥ
        vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhaḥ
        sthita-dhīr munir ucyate

So, Krishna talks about that in answer to Arjuna's question about hy..., "kā
bhāṣā":

        sthita-prajñasya kā bhāṣā
        samādhi-sthasya keśava
        sthita-dhīḥ kiṁ prabhāṣeta

So, that, 2.54 was Arjuna's question which are four questions. 2.55 was the
answer. You know, "kā bhāṣā". What are the characteristics? And 56 and 57 were
the answer. "kiṁ prabhāṣeta". So, there, also, "vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhaḥ" was
there. So, there, Prabhupada explained, attachment, aversion and f..., you know,
"vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhaḥ", Prabhupada, person, the devotee, when the, he is
serving the Lord, he is not attached. Neither frustrated, not fearful. So, he is
courageous. So, n..., now, Prabhupada uses deeper explanation of these three
factors in this purport. So, let us look at this. So, first, Srila Prabhupada
explains "rāga". So, what he says is, when people are in "rāga". In mater...,
people are, people who are so abs..., abso..., possible:

"people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in
materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand how the Supreme
can be a person."

So, here, Srila Prabhupada makes the first point is, first, he says that when we
are too materially conscious, then we think of everything in terms of matter. So,
first problem is that when we are attached to matter. We do not want to think
about G..., God, only. We think, you know, actually, I am enjoying over here. I
am happy over here. Why do I need anything else? Why do I need God at all? I am
happy. So, one does not care for God if one is very attached. The only ways in
one make care for God while one is attached is if one feels that by that God can
help me enjoy over here better. Then, only, one will care for God. But then,
that is not really caring for God. That is caring for the things of the world.
And using God as a tool to the things of this world. As Prabhupada would say,
when we ask God for bread, that shows our love for bread, not love for God. So,
like that, that "rāga" prevents us from "man-mayā". We may pray to God. But even
when we are praying to God, we are not thinking about God. We are thinking about
the things of the world which God may give us. So, this prevents us from
"upāśritāḥ". There may be some level of religion that is being practiced. But
"upāśritāḥ". Taking shelter of Krishna is not possible. And then, Prabhupada
says that "rāga-bhaya-krodhā". So, they cannot think of spiritual form. They
think, form means material form. So:

"people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of
the personal form of the Lord. For such materialistic men, the form of the
gigantic material manifestation is supreme."

So, they think that there is nothing beyond matter. And if there is a God at
all, then that God is, that God is transcendental. You know, that God cannot be
personal. Because they assume that form and personality are characteristic of
material realm, only. So, a, so, "vīta", so, this "rāga" creates such
attachments that do not think about God. And even they do think about God, if,
wh..., why do they think? Because the "rāga" is frustrated. They try, they
become attracted to the forms of this world. And they found those forms are
disappointing. They try to develop relationships in the world. And they found
that disappointing. So, by all this, they start feeling. There must be something
higher in life. There must be something which must be beyond this. But because
they are so averse to material things. So, what Prabhupada says is:

"because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of retaining the
personality after liberation from matter frightens them."

So, that is the, Prabhupada is explanation of, Prabhupada's explanation of
"bhaya" over here.

"When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal,
they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a
kind of merging into the impersonal void."

So, here, Srila Prabhupada is making the point that when we project the material
conception on the Absolute, then we think, oh, I have to form re..., I, whenever
I try to form relationships, it leads to misunderstanding. That leads to
heartbreaks. So, if I have, have a relationship in the spiritual realm, also.
That will also lead to misunderstanding. That will also lead to heartbreaks.
Better I do not want any relationships. Let us forget it. What do I want?
Shanti. Shanti. Shanti. So, based on one's materialistic conceptions,
intellectually and emotionally, one recoils from a personal conception of the
Absolute. Intellectually, one, in one's conceptions, the form and matter are
rooted together. People cannot think, how there can be form without matter. How
there can be spiritual form. Yeah. Of, matter means form. As if, form is not
there. Then, that means, you know, if matter is there, form has to be there. And
if form is there, matter has to be there. How can the two be separated? You
know. You know. They just cannot conceive of a spiritual form. Their idea of
spirit is not just spiritual. Their idea of spirit is primarily anti-material.
So, they cannot think of spirit in its own glory. So, they think that by
negating matter, we will get spirit. So, if matter has form. Then, spirit should
be formless. So, with this conception, they cannot m..., m..., get a personal
understanding. And they remain fearful of the personal aspect. So, that is why
they cannot do "man-mayā mām upāśritāḥ". Gi..., they cannot think of Krishna and
take shelter of Krishna. Because of their fear of the personal co..., conception
of relationshps in the spiritual realm. And then, after that, there is "krodhā".
So, Prabhupada explains. What is "krodhā"?

"Being embarrassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of
philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude
that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void."

They are ultimately void. So, here, "krodhā" refers not just to anger. Here,
"krodhā" refers to something deeper. It refers to the anger which comes from
frustration. When one cannot understand what is the ultimate truth of life.
These people said this is right. These people said this is right. Some people
say that God is like this. Some people say God is like that. Some people say God
is like that. Wha..., what is the truth? Then, I find it out. I cannot find it
out. You know, everybody present their philsophy very persuasively. And
everybody seems to be right. So, what, how do I find what is right? Better do
not get into this business, only. Better forget the whole thing. And they say,
what is Absolute Truth? Ultimately, everything is a void. So, they just do not
care that "krodhā" is a result of the, of scepticism. So, when one is
excessively sceptical. And one is not ready to make a commitment, find out what
is the truth. Then, one falls prey to this "krodhā". So, when Prabhupada was
asked about this "kro...", scepticism, Prabhupada says, scepticism means
rascalism. Why? He said just because you cannot find the truth. That does not
mean nobody can find the truth. That does not mean that nobody i..., i..., is a
capable of finding the truth. Prabhupada says that, yes, you know, just like a
fox, when it sees the grapes. And it sees the grapes are too far away. So, it
says, sour grapes. So, those grapes are sour. So, like that, we cannot
understand the truths. So, we say there is no truth, only. So, how do we know
what is the truth? See, there is one truth. There are many paths to the truth.
And it is not necessary that there is such a way. One think right and
everything has to be wrong. There is, you know, truth is like pyramid. So,
progress only, we get clearer and clearer understanding as we move forwards. But
essentially, there is inner transformation that happens. We become purified. We
start developing attraction to Krishna. So, in that way, there is a process by
which we can verify. You know, for example, if somebody says that, oh, there are
so many different therapies. There are naturo..., naturopathy. There is, you
know, ayurveda. There is allopathy. There is homeopathy. There is so many. There
are so many pathies like that. And different doctors give entirely different
explanations of, you know, what is the disease. And how it can be cured. What
should I do? Better do not get into this medicine business, only. Because just,
I do not, I will not go to any doctor. Because there is no way I can find out
what is right. So, we, if somebody thinks like this, then who is the loser? It
is that person who is the loser. That person continues to stay diseased. And
that person continues to stay suffering in material existence. So, that per...,
in a diseased condition. Similarly, just there are different, you know,
spiritual paths. You know, but there is an objective criteria. They are all
meant ultimately to heal. And the way we understand whether a path is right or
not, we use our intelligence to analyse. But then, we put, invest our
consciousness. If we get purified, we get spiritually healed. Then, we
understand this medicine works. So, like that, if we experience benefit from our
spiritual practice, then we should practice it. And that is how we move forward
in our spiritual life by practicing. Now, "vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhā". So, then,
Prabhupada wri..., starts referring here to hippies.

"This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication, and
their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision."

Affective hallucination means, so, somebody sees something. So, Prabhupada, you
know, so, somebody told Prabhupada. Prabhupada, you know, when I was taking
LSD, I used to get these kind of visions. Prabhupada says, stop taking, me...,
LSD. The vision will go away. Certainly, he says, no. He was so shocked. He was
completely deflated. He said, he thought his visions are such a wonderful
thing. And I am getting visions. I am spiritual person. Prabhupada said, you
cannot get spiritual visions by drugs. You know. Actually, spiritual vision, you
will get, by, when you become purified. So, actually, many times in that, you
know, when Prabhupada was in, you know, the first, at Lower Heatise..., East
Side. And then, Haight-Ashbury. First, in New York. And then, in San Francisco.
So, if somebody went high on LSD, then that person would be considered to be an
LSD saint. You know, a person, who, just like, a saint has some extraordinary
vision. And if some, there is, suppose, say, it has gone to samādhi. And while
in samādhi, the saint has, acting in a particular way. Maybe speaking certain
things. Dancing madly. Whatever. So, everybody stands there reverentially. Ok.
Ok. This person gone to ecstasy. So, like that, this person is a saintly
ecstasy. So, people would think that if somebody has taken high on, gone high on
LSD. And that person can speak any nonsense. Oh, these are the revelations of
the saint coming out. People would say. Oh, LSD saint. So, Prabhupada says, this
is, this is, you know, this is not a, you know, sensible. You know, anybody
takes drugs. And anybody gets any ideas. How can? They will be considered
spiritual vision. So, Prabhupada says one has to get all these three. One has to
get rid of all three stages of attachment to the material conce..., material
world. All these three stages of attachment. What are these? Negligence of
spiritual life. This happens when there is "rāga". Fear of a personal spiritual
personal identity. That is "bhaya". And the conception of a void that arises
from frustration in life. That is "krodhā". So, all these three, when one gives
up, then one can practice spiritual life sincerely. Be..., you know, now, when
Krishna tells us this path, He tells us that many other people have already
practiced it. "bahavo jñāna-tapasā". So, Krishna will talk about this once again
in 4.15, also. When He will say many others have practiced it. And they have
become liberated. And Krishna has referred to this earlier, also, in 3.20.

        karmaṇaiva hi saṁsiddhim
        āsthitā janakādayaḥ
        loka-saṅgraham evāpi
        sampaśyan kartum arhasi

So, He says, "karmaṇaiva hi saṁsiddhim". By karma itself, one has attained
perfection. "karmaṇaiva hi saṁsi...", "āsthitā janakādayaḥ". Who are the people
who have urgent profession like this? "janakādayaḥ". There are many others.
Janaka and others who have attained perfection. Similarly, Krishna is saying,
"bahavo jñāna-tapasā". Many others have attained perfection. So, this is giving
an assurance to Krishna. Just like, if somebody, if somebody says, I, if
somebody, a doctor says, you know, I am a specialist doctor. And, you know, I
have to do brain surgery. So, yes, doctor. What is your experience? How many
patience have you operated on? Oh, you have the honor of being my first
patient. Oh, I do not want that honor, doctor. I will go to some other doctor,
that is. So, if somebody is absolute nothing, absolutely new. And it is our
life that is addressed. We would not want to put our life to risk like that. We
would want to, so, ok, this experienced doctor. You know, and the, many people
have done this surgery. And people have got, become cured. So, like that,
"jñāna-tapasā", "bahavo". Many have become purified. Now, Krishna uses an
interesting compound word over here. "jñāna-tapasā". So, "tapasā" means
austerity. "jñāna" means knowledge. So, what is that "jñāna-tapasā" mean? The
austerity of knowledge. So, actually, you know, hearing about Krishna. And
understanding Krishna's glories, that can be an austerity, sometimes. Actually,
it purifies us. And you know, eventually, it fills us with great joy. When we
start understanding Krishna's glories. But initially, or transitionally, it may
happen that for some time, we may find, you know, the glories of Krishna, you
know, annoying. Irritating. Boring. Draining. Bewildering. There are different
emotions that can go on. Annoying. You know, why Krishna is supreme? I want my
own glories to broadcast. So, so, why hear about Krishna's glories, only? You
know. Boring. You know. The same things again and again. How will then, we are
in training? Very irritating. What is this pastime? It does not make sense. Why
does Krishna act like this? So, "janma karma ca me divyam". The pastimes of
Krishna, hearing about them gets sometimes we are in austerity. Of course, many
times, we pre..., find that, you know, if hearing pastimes, we are not in
austerity. We are, enjoy hearing pastimes as long as they are new pastimes. If
the same pastimes had been once, twice, thrice, four time, now, it is enough. He
said, if there is some new pastime is there. Please tell me some new pastime.
That attitude comes up. So, but if the new pastimes are new. And they are
entertainingly told be like them. But "tattvataḥ". Understanding the "tattva".
And then, understanding the pastime. That requires eff..., that requires
austerity. So, "jñāna-tapasā". But Krishna assures us that we do "jñāna-tapasā".
What will be the result? "pūtā". We will become purified. So, hearing about
Krishna's glories purifies us. And when we will become, a m..., purified, then
our original natural attraction to Krishna becomes revived the, by that
purification. So, purify and revive. Revive our attraction. That is a
conclusion. "mad-bhāvam āgatāḥ". They attain "bhāva" for me. So, Prabhupada
tra..., connects this "bhāva" with the nine stages of bhakti. Which is talked
about in the Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu". The eighth among them being "bhāva". So:

        ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-
        saṅgo ...
        
S..., so, we know "śradd...", the spiritual life begins with faith. Then, there
is "sādhu-saṅgo". We come in the association of devotees. Then, devotees tell us
please chant Hare Krishna. "bhajana-kriyā". Then, "bhajana-kriyā". What happens?
Start experiencing transformation. Our bad habits fall away. There is
"’nartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt"

        tato niṣṭhā rucis tataḥ

Then, "niṣṭhā". Our faith becomes strong. Just like when we take a treatment.
And we become cured by that treatment, the disease subsides. And says, starts,
oh, this will, treatment work. "niṣṭhā". Then, after that "rucis tataḥ". Then,
"athāsaktis". "rucis" is taste. "athāsaktis" is attachment. Just like, we
discussed in the Nectar of Instruction, how initially, sugarcane juice does not
taste, you know, sweet for a jaundice person. But as the person gets cured,
then, you know, first of all, the person receives feeling goes away. So,
"niṣṭhā". Yes. This treatment work. But after that, hey, this sugarcane is so,
so true, sweet. I want to take it more. And, so, "niṣṭhā rucis". "athāsaktis".
So, attachment comes up. And then, "bhāvas". "bhāvas" means we start becoming,
expe..., we not only, you know, feel nice when we chant. When we remember
Krishna. When we serve Krishna. But along with that, "bhāvas". We feel positive
spiritual affection for Krishna. And then, "bhāvas". And then, finally comes
"premā". "premā" is spontaneous spiritual love for Krishna. And then, what he
says?

        tataḥ premābhyudañcati

"sādha...", "sādhanā...":

        sādhakānām ayaṁ premṇaḥ
        prādurbhāve bhavet kramaḥ

"sādhakānām". For the seekers. "ayaṁ premṇaḥ". This "premā". "prādurbhāve
bhavet kramaḥ". That step by step, this love will come gradually. You know, this
is Prabhupada quoting "Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu". And the correlation is "bhāva".
"mad-bhāvam āgatāḥ". What is that "mad-bhāvam"? Prabhupada, Krishna is saying,
say, referring to, that is e..., that person will attain love for Me. So, when
we give up a, the obstac..., when we go, you know, put aside the conceptions that
act as obstacles, "rāga-bhaya-krodhā". And s..., start surrendering to Krishna,
then we become purified. So, "mad-bhāvam āgatāḥ". Now, let us look at the next
verse. So, here, we start the next section of the Bhagavad Gita. And this is one
of the most important verses. So, here, the second section is Krishna is the
goal and creator of all paths. Now, when I am giving sections, you know, no
acharya has very specifically stated that this verse to this verse is a section.
This verse to se..., this verse is this section. There have been given some
outlines by Chakravarti Pada, Baladeva Vidyabhushana. So, different devotees
may classify the sections of the Bhagavad Gita in different ways. So, this is
something which is not integral to the test. That is something which we create
as a framework for our own understanding. So, there may be different, the, you
know, you know, different Bhagavad Gita teachers who may, you know, analyse the
Gita sections into different ways. And that is perfectly ok. As long as it gives
us a continuity of understanding. And clarity of understanding. So, as long that
happens, the co..., sections can be given in different ways. So, here, Krishna
is the goal and creator of all paths. So, now, what is the point, connection
between the first and second section? First, Krishna teaches and establishes
dharma. What is dharma? Dharma involves, you know, the pro..., practice of
religion. So that one becomes purified. So, now, the, for this purification,
there are multiple processes. You know, Krishna has actually recommended here,
"man-mayā mām upāśritāḥ". Take shelter of me. And practice bhakti-yoga. And come
back to me. But, you know, not everybody wants to practice bhakti-yoga. There
are other processes, also. So, what about those different processes? What
happens to those who practice those different processes? That, Krishna will
dis..., discuss in this section. And that is what we will start now. So, Krishna
right in the beginning gives us a first, a principle. The principle of what we
should do. Or, how we should understand these different processes. So:

        ye yathā māṁ prapadyante
        tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham
        mama vartmānuvartante
        manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ

So, "ye yathā". As in what way? Those who, those who in whatever way. "māṁ
prapadyante". They surrender unto Me. So, this "prapadyante" is releated with
the previous verse, it, "upāśritāḥ". People take shelter of Me. So, different
people surrender to Me in different ways. In whatever way, they surrender. "tāṁs
tathaiva bhajāmy aham". I reward them accordingly. "tāṁs tathaiva". Accordingly,
I reward them. And "mama vartmānuvartante". That actually, people follow My
path. "mama vartmā". "vartma" is path. "anuvartante" is to follow. "manuṣyāḥ
pārtha sarvaśaḥ". So, "sarvaśaḥ" is an adjective that peo..., all people follow
my path. So, all people follow my path. And I reward people according to how
they surrender to Me. That, that means there are actually two distinctive
sections in this verse. We will look at these two sections. And then, we will
look at, try to understand what is the correlation between the two. Now,
significantly, generally, impersonalists like to quote the second part of this
verse. Whereas vaishnavas are, Srila Prabhupada frequently quotes the first
part. So, first part is the principle of reciprocity. As, as different people
surrender unto Me, the Lord rewards accordingly. That means the Lord is
reciprocal. The Lord is not, you know, not a, absolutely like a stone. You know,
whatever a..., anybody does, the Lord will stay the same. No. Lord reciprocates.
So, how does He reciprocate? "ye yathā māṁ prapadyante". So, Visvanatha
Chakravarti Thakura explains beautifully in his purport. And Prabhupada also
points to this. That those who consider the Lor..., or those who consider the
Lord, His activities, birth and activities, "janma karma". The, if the, they,
they think their "janma karma" is "divyam". Oh, the Lord's activities in, you
know, bir..., appearance are transcendental. Those who think my activities to
be transcendental. So, Krishna makes their activities transcendental. That means
what? Krishna purifies them. And when they become purified, then they become
liberated. They also start li..., living and acting in the transcendental
platform. So, those who accept Krishna's activities to be transcendental, their
activities become transcendental. So, those who consider Krishna's activities to
be material, their activities remain material. Those who think that Krishna is
just a, what is this Krishna? You know, He is just a, some historical character
or some mythological character. And, so they are materialistic, their activities
also stay mat..., they, Krishna says, ok, you stay, take off him
materialistically, then you continue on cycle of birth and death. So, those who
think of Krishna, you know, you know, in a monastic way, in a mayavadi way. They
think that, actually, Krishna is a man t..., every man is such an impersonal
Brahman. So, that is also an offensive conception. So, they are too much focused
on material conception, only. Because what is happening is they are assuming
that all forms are material. So, they are not beco..., broken free from the
fetter of matter. Fetter of matter. Feetter is a shackle. Because they have not
broken free from the fetter of matter, so, they stay on in material existence.
And when they stay on in material existence, then they also suffer. So, you
know, Krishna says that as people approach me with whatever conception, I reward
accordingly. I reciprocate accordingly.

        tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham
        mama vartmānuvartante

Now, so, this is the first part. The different people, I reciprocate
accordingly. This will be expanded later on in the Bhagavad Gita. And We will
discuss at that time, also, as we move forward in the flow. But "mama
vartmānuvartante". That, you know, all people follow My path. Now, this is,
verse is often tra..., mistranslated as all paths lead to Me. Now, if we look
at this verse:

        mama vartmānuvartante
        manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ

So, you know, now, if you see "sarvaśaḥ" is close to "manuṣyāḥ". So, "sarvaśaḥ".
All people are on My path. "mama vartmā". Now, so, if we suddenly move
"sarvaśaḥ", "su", "vartmā". All paths lead to Me. It does not make a, proper
grammatical sense. Of course, some people argue that there is a figure of
speech in, you know, you know, called transferred epithet where an adjective is
moved away from one noun to another noun. So, like, there goes the, a traveler
on the weary path. That, now, the, the, pa..., weary is tired. So, the, it is
not the path that is tired. The traveler is tired. So, like that, some people
say that, this is a transferred epithet example. But the point is, Krishna is
very, here talking in a very analytical tone. And if we see, if it is just a
transferred epithet, if all paths were ultimately to lead to Him, then how do we
understand very categorical verses? Like, say, Krishna has said in four, you
know, 3.31, 32 that those who have faith, they will come to Me. Those who do not
have faith, they will fall back. So, if all paths were lead to Krishna, then
a..., what do you, what about such verses which clearly delineate two paths and
two destinations? So, two conceptions, two destinations. So, for, there is 9.25,
also very categorical.

        yānti deva-vratā devān
        pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ
        bhūtāni yānti bhūtejyā
        yānti mad-yājino ’pi mām

So, Krishna is talking about four different conceptions or four different
object, objects of worship. And four different destinations. So, the idea that:

        mama vartmānuvartante
        manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ

Refers to all paths lead to the same goal. That cannot be sustained, you know,
by comparison with other verses in the Gita. And so, scripturally, gramatically,
also, it does not make sense. Then, contextually, from the whole message of the
Gita, it does not make sense. And logically, also, if we look at it, you know,
you know, it does not make sense. If whatever anybody does in, the people are
going to come to Krishna. Then, what does it mean? Then, it means that,
actually, Arjuna does not need to fight. Because whether Arjuna fights or does
not fight, ultimately, everybody is on a, Krishna's path. And everybody will come
back to Krishna, only. So, Prabhupada asked the simple question that, you know,
if whatever we do in, Kri..., we are going to go back to Krishna. Then, why does
Krishna have to speak the Bhagavad Gita at all? Why does Krishna have to
persuade Arjuna to choose any particular course of action? He does not have to.
So, therefore, this, you know, particular idea that all paths lead to the same
goal is not a valid translation of this verse. Then, what does this verse
actually mean? What does it mean that all people are on My path? It means
something important. That it means, firstly, that actually whatever a person is
attracted to, actually, that person is attracted to manifestation of Krishna.
So, for example, now, if we consider all of existence to be a, like a massive
expressway. You know, some people, so, the, in that expressway, Krishna is
transcendental. Then, there is goodness, passion, ignorance. And different
people are attracted to different things. So, when they are attracted to
different things, what does it mean that they are attracted to? Some people are
attracted to the beauty of the opposite sex. Some people are attracted to
learning. Some people are attracted to, you know, the, a..., alcohol and
intoxication. These are example of passion, goodness and ignorance attractions.
So, when they are attracted like this, what does it mean? Actually, all these
attractions are ultimately ha..., ca..., having the capacity to attract. Because
they contain a spark of Krishna's opulence. This, we will discuss in 10.41, in,
when we come to Tenth Chapter.

        yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ
        śrīmad ūrjitam eva vā
        tat tad evāvagaccha tvaṁ
        mama tejo-’ṁśa-sambhavam

That, you know, everything that is beautiful, it has this attracting capacity
because it possesses spark of Krishna's splendor. Now, if somebody may say that
the beauty of the opposite sex is also the beauty of Krishna, then what is wrong
with getting attracted to the beauty of the opposite sex? If, actually, yes, it
is ultimately by Krishna's arrangement that even the opposite sex is beautiful.
But that attraction does not connect us with Krishna. That, the, the spark comes
from the fire. But is this attraction, the spark taking us to the fire? 30:13
