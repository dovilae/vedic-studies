Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course, last
series. So, today, we will discuss the Fourth Chapter. We are concluding the
first section of the Fourth Chapter. And then, we will move on to the second
section. So, we discussed about ho..., why Krishna appears. So, at one level,
Krishna appears to give us, a, to teach dharma. And to establish order of a
real. Krishna teaches and establishes dharma. That was the first section. But
then, we discussed dharma does not mean just establishing order over here.
Dharma also means, He is setting up an order over here so that people can come
out of this material world and return back to Him. So, for that, one has to have
"tattvataḥ". Understanding of Krishna. So, now, let us move forward and look at
4.10. So, now, in 4.9, Krishna has said that the people who understand me in
truth will come back to me. Now, in this verse, after this, He explains, what
are the obstacles to understanding Him in truth. So, three obstacles, He
mentions. And Prabhupada elaborates them, profoundly in his purport. So, we
will look at those three obstacles. And then, once we become free from these
three obstacles, how we can attain the shelter of Krishna. That is what Krishna
tells.

        vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhā
        man-mayā mām upāśritāḥ
        bahavo jñāna-tapasā
        pūtā mad-bhāvam āgatāḥ

So, "vīta". "vīta" means to become free from. "rāga-bhaya-krodhā". "rāga" is
attachment. "bhaya" is fear. And "krodhā" is anger, born of frustration. Anger.
So, when a person becomes free from these three things. Then, "man-mayā". That
person can fix the mind on Me. "mām upāśritāḥ". They can, that person can take
shelter of Me. So, this is the first time in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna is using
the word "āśritāḥ" for "mām", "āśritāḥ". To take shelter of Me. This will come
again and again in the Gita. But it is the first reference. "mām āś...",
"upāśritāḥ". And then, what? "bahavo jñāna-tapasā". So, Krishna is telling that
this path, which I am telling you, you know, of taking she..., fixing the mind
on Me and taking shelter of Me. Actually, many people have done that in the
past. "bahavo" is many. "jñāna-tapasā". By the austerity of knowledge. "pūtā".
They have become purified. And "mad-bhāvam āgatāḥ". They have attained my
"bhāva". They have attained divine emotion for me. "bhāva" refers to emotion.
So, they have attained transcendental love for me. So, Krishna says,
"vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhā". So, the same phrase, "vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhā" had come
in the Second Chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. When Krishna was talking about
"sthita-prajña". You know, "sthi...", "sthita-prajña". "munir". So, He says:

        duḥkheṣv anudvigna-manāḥ
        sukheṣu vigata-spṛhaḥ
        vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhaḥ
        sthita-dhīr munir ucyate

So, Krishna talks about that in answer to Arjuna's question about hy..., "kā
bhāṣā":

        sthita-prajñasya kā bhāṣā
        samādhi-sthasya keśava
        sthita-dhīḥ kiṁ prabhāṣeta

So, that, 2.54 was Arjuna's question which are four questions. 2.55 was the
answer. You know, "kā bhāṣā". What are the characteristics? And 56 and 57 were
the answer. "kiṁ prabhāṣeta". So, there, also, "vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhaḥ" was
there. So, there, Prabhupada explained, attachment, aversion and f..., you know,
"vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhaḥ", Prabhupada, person, the devotee, when the, he is
serving the Lord, he is not attached. Neither frustrated, not fearful. So, he is
courageous. So, n..., now, Prabhupada uses deeper explanation of these three
factors in this purport. So, let us look at this. So, first, Srila Prabhupada
explains "rāga". So, what he says is, when people are in "rāga". In mater...,
people are, people who are so abs..., abso..., possible:

"people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in
materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand how the Supreme
can be a person."

So, here, Srila Prabhupada makes the first point is, first, he says that when we
are too materially conscious, then we think of everything in terms of matter. So,
first problem is that when we are attached to matter. We do not want to think
about G..., God, only. We think, you know, actually, I am enjoying over here. I
am happy over here. Why do I need anything else? Why do I need God at all? I am
happy. So, one does not care for God if one is very attached. The only ways in
one make care for God while one is attached is if one feels that by that God can
help me enjoy over here better. Then, only, one will care for God. But then,
that is not really caring for God. That is caring for the things of the world.
And using God as a tool to the things of this world. As Prabhupada would say,
when we ask God for bread, that shows our love for bread, not love for God. So,
like that, that "rāga" prevents us from "man-mayā". We may pray to God. But even
when we are praying to God, we are not thinking about God. We are thinking about
the things of the world which God may give us. So, this prevents us from
"upāśritāḥ". There may be some level of religion that is being practiced. But
"upāśritāḥ". Taking shelter of Krishna is not possible. And then, Prabhupada
says that "rāga-bhaya-krodhā". So, they cannot think of spiritual form. They
think, form means material form. So:

"people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of
the personal form of the Lord. For such materialistic men, the form of the
gigantic material manifestation is supreme."

So, they think that there is nothing beyond matter. And if there is a God at
all, then that God is, that God is transcendental. You know, that God cannot be
personal. Because they assume that form and personality are characteristic of
material realm, only. So, a, so, "vīta", so, this "rāga" creates such
attachments that do not think about God. And even they do think about God, if,
wh..., why do they think? Because the "rāga" is frustrated. They try, they
become attracted to the forms of this world. And they found those forms are
disappointing. They try to develop relationships in the world. And they found
that disappointing. So, by all this, they start feeling. There must be something
higher in life. There must be something which must be beyond this. But because
they are so averse to material things. So, what Prabhupada says is:

"because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of retaining the
personality after liberation from matter frightens them."

So, that is the, Prabhupada is explanation of, Prabhupada's explanation of
"bhaya" over here.

"When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal,
they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a
kind of merging into the impersonal void."

So, here, Srila Prabhupada is making the point that when we project the material
conception on the Absolute, then we think, oh, I have to form re..., I, whenever
I try to form relationships, it leads to misunderstanding. That leads to
heartbreaks. So, if I have, have a relationship in the spiritual realm, also.
That will also lead to misunderstanding. That will also lead to heartbreaks.
Better I do not want any relationships. Let us forget it. What do I want?
Shanti. Shanti. Shanti. So, based on one's materialistic conceptions,
intellectually and emotionally, one recoils from a personal conception of the
Absolute. Intellectually, one, in one's conceptions, the form and matter are
rooted together. People cannot think, how there can be form without matter. How
there can be spiritual form. Yeah. Of, matter means form. As if, form is not
there. Then, that means, you know, if matter is there, form has to be there. And
if form is there, matter has to be there. How can the two be separated? You
know. You know. They just cannot conceive of a spiritual form. Their idea of
spirit is not just spiritual. Their idea of spirit is primarily anti-material.
So, they cannot think of spirit in its own glory. So, they think that by
negating matter, we will get spirit. So, if matter has form. Then, spirit should
be formless. So, with this conception, they cannot m..., m..., get a personal
understanding. And they remain fearful of the personal aspect. So, that is why
they cannot do "man-mayā mām upāśritāḥ". Gi..., they cannot think of Krishna and
take shelter of Krishna. Because of their fear of the personal co..., conception
of relationshps in the spiritual realm. And then, after that, there is "krodhā".
So, Prabhupada explains. What is "krodhā"?

"Being embarrassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of
philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude
that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void."

They are ultimately void. So, here, "krodhā" refers not just to anger. Here,
"krodhā" refers to something deeper. It refers to the anger which comes from
frustration. When one cannot understand what is the ultimate truth of life.
These people said this is right. These people said this is right. Some people
say that God is like this. Some people say God is like that. Some people say God
is like that. Wha..., what is the truth? Then, I find it out. I cannot find it
out. You know, everybody present their philsophy very persuasively. And
everybody seems to be right. So, what, how do I find what is right? Better do
not get into this business, only. Better forget the whole thing. And they say,
what is Absolute Truth? Ultimately, everything is a void. So, they just do not
care that "krodhā" is a result of the, of scepticism. So, when one is
excessively sceptical. And one is not ready to make a commitment, find out what
is the truth. Then, one falls prey to this "krodhā". So, when Prabhupada was
asked about this "kro...", scepticism, Prabhupada says, scepticism means
rascalism. Why? He said just because you cannot find the truth. That does not
mean nobody can find the truth. That does not mean that nobody i..., i..., is a
capable of finding the truth. Prabhupada says that, yes, you know, just like a
fox, when it sees the grapes. And it sees the grapes are too far away. So, it
says, sour grapes. So, those grapes are sour. So, like that, we cannot
understand the truths. So, we say there is no truth, only. So, how do we know
what is the truth? See, there is one truth. There are many paths to the truth.
And it is not necessary that there is such a way. One think right and
everything has to be wrong. There is, you know, truth is like pyramid. So,
progress only, we get clearer and clearer understanding as we move forwards. But
essentially, there is inner transformation that happens. We become purified. We
start developing attraction to Krishna. So, in that way, there is a process by
which we can verify. You know, for example, if somebody says that, oh, there are
so many different therapies. There are naturo..., naturopathy. There is, you
know, ayurveda. There is allopathy. There is homeopathy. There is so many. There
are so many pathies like that. And different doctors give entirely different
explanations of, you know, what is the disease. And how it can be cured. What
should I do? Better do not get into this medicine business, only. Because just,
I do not, I will not go to any doctor. Because there is no way I can find out
what is right. So, we, if somebody thinks like this, then who is the loser? It
is that person who is the loser. That person continues to stay diseased. And
that person continues to stay suffering in material existence. So, that per...,
in a diseased condition. Similarly, just there are different, you know,
spiritual paths. You know, but there is an objective criteria. They are all
meant ultimately to heal. And the way we understand whether a path is right or
not, we use our intelligence to analyse. But then, we put, invest our
consciousness. If we get purified, we get spiritually healed. Then, we
understand this medicine works. So, like that, if we experience benefit from our
spiritual practice, then we should practice it. And that is how we move forward
in our spiritual life by practicing. Now, "vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhā". So, then,
Prabhupada wri..., starts referring here to hippies.

"This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication, and
their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision."

Affective hallucination means, so, somebody sees something. So, Prabhupada, you
know, so, somebody told Prabhupada. Prabhupada, you know, when I was taking
LSD, I used to get these kind of visions. Prabhupada says, stop taking, me...,
LSD. The vision will go away. Certainly, he says, no. He was so shocked. He was
completely deflated. He said, he thought his visions are such a wonderful
thing. And I am getting visions. I am spiritual person. Prabhupada said, you
cannot get spiritual visions by drugs. You know. Actually, spiritual vision, you
will get, by, when you become purified. So, actually, many times in that, you
know, when Prabhupada was in, you know, the first, at Lower Heatise..., East
Side. And then, Haight-Ashbury. First, in New York. And then, in San Francisco.
So, if somebody went high on LSD, then that person would be considered to be an
LSD saint. You know, a person, who, just like, a saint has some extraordinary
vision. And if some, there is, suppose, say, it has gone to samādhi. And while
in samādhi, the saint has, acting in a particular way. Maybe speaking certain
things. Dancing madly. Whatever. So, everybody stands there reverentially. Ok.
Ok. This person gone to ecstasy. So, like that, this person is a saintly
ecstasy. So, people would think that if somebody has taken high on, gone high on
LSD. And that person can speak any nonsense. Oh, these are the revelations of
the saint coming out. People would say. Oh, LSD saint. So, Prabhupada says, this
is, this is, you know, this is not a, you know, sensible. You know, anybody
takes drugs. And anybody gets any ideas. How can? They will be considered
spiritual vision. So, Prabhupada says one has to get all these three. One has to
get rid of all three stages of attachment to the material conce..., material
world. All these three stages of attachment. What are these? Negligence of
spiritual life. This happens when there is "rāga". Fear of a personal spiritual
personal identity. That is "bhaya". And the conception of a void that arises
from frustration in life. That is "krodhā". So, all these three, when one gives
up, then one can practice spiritual life sincerely. Be..., you know, now, when
Krishna tells us this path, He tells us that many other people have already
practiced it. "bahavo jñāna-tapasā". So, Krishna will talk about this once again
in 4.15, also. When He will say many others have practiced it. And they have
become liberated. And Krishna has referred to this earlier, also, in 3.20.

        karmaṇaiva hi saṁsiddhim
        āsthitā janakādayaḥ
        loka-saṅgraham evāpi
        sampaśyan kartum arhasi

So, He says, "karmaṇaiva hi saṁsiddhim". By karma itself, one has attained
perfection. "karmaṇaiva hi saṁsi...", "āsthitā janakādayaḥ". Who are the people
who have urgent profession like this? "janakādayaḥ". There are many others.
Janaka and others who have attained perfection. Similarly, Krishna is saying,
"bahavo jñāna-tapasā". Many others have attained perfection. So, this is giving
an assurance to Krishna. Just like, if somebody, if somebody says, I, if
somebody, a doctor says, you know, I am a specialist doctor. And, you know, I
have to do brain surgery. So, yes, doctor. What is your experience? How many
patience have you operated on? Oh, you have the honor of being my first
patient. Oh, I do not want that honor, doctor. I will go to. 15:31
