Hare Krishna. Welcome to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are now in
the last part of the Fifth Chapter. We have discussed till 5.24. So, in this
last section, Krishna is telling that how a yogi can attain liberation by fixing
the mind on Supreme Lord. And this sec..., a, crux of this discussion is the
redirection of our pleasure-seeking propensity from matter to spirit. From
outwards to inwards. So, you know, 5.20 said that, a person who is equipoised
amidst pleasure and pain stays, you know, comes to the spiritual platform. 5.21
says, for that, one should be detached from external pleasures. And then, one
can attain unlimited spiritual happiness. 5.22 said that, how, you know, what is
the basis for detaching oneself from external pleasures. Understanding that they
are wombs of misery. They are temporary. And they will end in misery. Then, 5.23
said that, yes, still, the desires may come. But one should tolerate them. And
then, 5.24 said that, we turn inwards. And delight inwards. Then, we will attain
the, you know, brahman platform. So, 5.20 and 24 are like a, a, this parts of a
cycle. So, f..., what, what, 5.20 talks about "brahma-vid brahmaṇi sthitaḥ".
That is what 5.24 also returns to. That such a person attains "brahma-nirvanam".
So, now, Krishna will continue that. And talk for, about attaining
"brahma-nirvanam". Attaining the spiritual platofrm. Let us look at the verse. 

        labhante brahma-nirvāṇam
        ṛṣayaḥ kṣīṇa-kalmaṣāḥ
        chinna-dvaidhā yatātmānaḥ
        sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ

So, "labhante" means, one attains. "brahma-nirvāṇam" is the spiritual platform.
It is consist, yesterday. Who attains it? "labhante" is to attain, gain.
"ṛṣayaḥ". "ṛṣayaḥ" is, now the word "ṛṣi" is used that we have Narada "ṛṣi". Or
Vyasa "ṛṣi". We use the word "ṛṣi", muni. Each of them have their specific
meanings. But generally, the word "ṛṣi" means one who turns inwards. That is a
context of the previous verse, also. The previous verse said that "ṛṣayaḥ".
Those who have turned inwards. "yo ’ntaḥ-sukho ’ntar-ārāmas". So, the previous
verse was talking about turning inwards. So, when this word is used in that
con.., you know, context. It will continue to mean that. You know, turn, one who
turns inwards. Prabhupada writes, those who are active within. What happens to
such people? "kṣīṇa-kalmaṣāḥ". So, "kalmaṣāḥ", m..., is, a, a, contaminations of
the heart. These will be destroyed. Now, Krishna has talked, used the same word
in 5.17. In, you know, the D part. "jñāna-nirdhūta-kalmaṣāḥ". "jñāna-nirdhūta".
So, by knowledge, the person has become freed from all contaminations.

        tad-buddhayas tad-ātmānas
        tan-niṣṭhās tat-parāyaṇāḥ
        gacchanty apunar-āvṛttiṁ
        jñāna-nirdhūta-kalmaṣāḥ

So, "jñāna-nirdhūta". One who had become free from all sins by, you know, by a
c..., all contaminations, by the power of jnana that is acquired by investing
one's mind. One's intelligence. One's faith. And one's em..., aspiration. So,
now, here, Krishna is saying the same point that the person who attains
"brahma-nirvāṇam" has to be "ṛṣayaḥ kṣīṇa-kalmaṣāḥ". And for becoming "ṛṣayaḥ
kṣīṇa-kalmaṣāḥ", "chinna-dvaidhā". "dvaidhā" is duality. "dva". "dva".
"dvandva". "dvaidhā". They are all related words. Which basically means duality.
That this is good. This is bad. "chinna-dvaidhā". One cuts through that. And the
person is "yatātmānaḥ". "yatātmānaḥ" means "yata-ātmānaḥ". So, one who is en...,
Prabhupada translates that as one who is engaged in self-realisation.
"yatātmānaḥ". "yata" can mean controlled. Renounced. So, one who is controlled
at the level of the soul. One who is, you know, focused on realising the soul.
"sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ". This is significant point. "sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ"
means such a person is engaged in the well-being of all. Now, what is the
connection of this with the overall, you know, a, theme of the verse? You know,
many people feel that those who pursue spiritual realisation, they are very
self-centered. You know, they do not bother about the world. They are simply
concerned about their own purification. Their own liberation. And they do not
care for others. Krishna says that is not the case. He says that those who are
striving for, those who, who are the people who will attain self-realisation?
Those who are "sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ". Those who are engaged in the welfare of
all living beings. Now, Krishna will talk, use the same describer,
"sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ", once again in the twelfth Chapter. When He is
describing the impersonalists. So, He says, you know, in 12.3, 4, and 5. He
talks about impersonalists. And then, He, there, He says, then:

        ye tv akṣaram anirdeśyam
        avyaktaṁ paryupāsate
        sarvatra-gam acintyaṁ ca
        kūṭa-stham acalaṁ dhruvam

        sanniyamyendriya-grāmaṁ
        sarvatra sama-buddhayaḥ
        te prāpnuvanti mām eva
        sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ

So, there, also, He uses the word "sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ". So, He says, those
impersonalists have to be engaged in the well-being of all. And they have to
contemplate on the all-pervading qualitiless, formless activity lays Brahman.
And eventually, they will also attain Me, Krishna says. But next verse is, He
says, very difficult process. "kleśo ’dhika-taras teṣām". 12.5. So, is it that
the impersonalists alone are well-wishers of all living beings? No. The point
is, even the impersonalists alo..., ve..., have to be well-wishers, have to be
benefitted for all living beings. What about, what to speak of devotees? Krishna
will talk about devotees in the same chapter, later, in 12.13. When He says, the
devotees are the well-wishing friends of all living beings. The:

        adveṣṭā sarva-bhūtānāṁ
        maitraḥ karuṇa eva ca

So, there, He will explain that My devotees are non-envious towards all living,
not only they are non-envious, they are "maitraḥ karuṇa". They are actually the
well-wishing friends of all living beings. "maitraḥ karuṇa eva ca". So, why are
these the friends? Because they see that all living beings are the parts of
Krishna. These are the children of Krishna. And we are all one family. So, how
can our beloved Lord be happy if those, if His other parts and parcels are
suffering? So, we have to do what we can to help them, also, to come back home.
The impersonalists, on the other hand, their compassion is not so personal based.
Because their, their ultimate reality is not personal. So, then, when their you
know, co..., emotions here will also not be personal. So, they,
"sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ", for them, is more that they should not discriminate
among various living beings. That means whoever be the living beings, they
should be able to have an attitude of compassion towards them. They should have
an attitude of, you know, you know, they should not discriminate. Oh, this
person is, I like this person. I do not like this person. They should have
samya. They should have equal vision towards everyone. And an equal, equally,
they should be having a benefit, benevolent attitude towards everyone. So, the
point is both kinds of spiritualists, whether they are personalists or
impersonalists, they are expected to engage in the welfare of all living beings.
Now, you know, what, what is the welfare that they ca..., should engage in? You
know, that is indicated by the qualifications that these people should have in
this verse. They are:

        ṛṣayaḥ kṣīṇa-kalmaṣāḥ
        chinna-dvaidhā yatātmānaḥ

They are "kṣīṇa-kalmaṣāḥ". They are freed from impurities. See, unless people
are freed from impurities, they cannot engage truly in the welfare of everyone.
Why? Because, you know, you know, when they want to engage in the welfare o...,
cro..., do welfare for everyone, they should know how to do welfare. You know,
if, now, so, at one level, doing welfare seems very simple. Oh, person is
starving. Give some food. The person does not have clothes. Give some clothes.
Yes, these are noble. These are compassionate. But the problems, a, playing
society are not so simple. Why are those people, why are those people hungry? Or
you know, bereaved? That is because there is a whole social cu..., you know,
economic complex that is governed by greed and exploitation? On one side, among
they have, s..., and that is fueled by the wantonness of everyone including the
have nots. Even the have nots do not have self-restraint. Many times, when we
give pleasure, some money. They use it for smoking instead of eating. So,
instead of taking food, they smoke or drink. So, we have discussed this
elaborately in our manava seva, madhava seva topic. The point is that helping,
also, requires some level of understanding of what is real help. So, the greed
and wantonness. Wantonness means the, you know, unrestricted, unregulated
indulgence in pleasures. Even self-defeating, self-destructive pleasures. That
is wantonness. And that, that has to be curbed. So, how is that to be dealt
with? That is to be dealt with by the practice of, you know, the, by the
attainment of higher spiritual happiness. Unless a person experiences higher
spiritual happiness, that person cannot give up lower happiness. When the person
does not give up lower happiness. Then, the person cannot, you know, actually do
good to others. Because the exploitative mentality will come up sooner or later.
And even if there is no exploitative men..., mentality. Even when there is,
actually, compassionate mentality. Still, the w..., a..., if we do not know. You
know, you know, a person may want to help a sick person. But if that person does
not know how to treat the sick person, how much help can be done. So, people are
sick because of lust, anger, greed, envy, pride, and illusion. And those who are
free from these contaminations, those who know how to pra..., treat others, they
can offer the best help. So, "ṛṣayaḥ kṣīṇa-kalmaṣāḥ". Those "ṛṣi"s, those who
are internally active. And "kṣīṇa-kalmaṣāḥ". Those who are free from
contaminations, they are the people who can help others. So, that is the, in a
sense, the qualification for helping others. Otherwise, we certainly, that does
not mean that everybody else is banned from helping others. Everybody, you know,
ha..., those who are, you know, concerned enough, noble enough, compassionate
enough to want to help others. They will naturally do what they can to help
others. And that, you know, that tendency of bei..., you know, being concerned
about others with some level of selflessness is to be appreciated. At the same
time, their help is not going to be complete. It is not going to be holistic. It
is not going to be sustainable. Because as long as we only help at the level of
the body, we cannot really help. The anarthas are present. Anarthas are
misleading, and degrading, and hurting people. Because they, you know, are
directing people's consciousness away from spiritual reality. Where l..., real
lasting happiness exists. So, people have to be rea..., help, people have to be
guided to redirect their consciousness to higher spiritual reality. You know.
When their con..., consciousness gets redirected over there. Then, they will
be, become freed from their infatuation with worldly things. And then, they will
be able to do good to others. And they will be able to receive good from others.
"sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ". That is why "ṛṣayaḥ kṣīṇa-kalmaṣāḥ". It is important
point that we, we, capable of, you know, you know, be, the, be pure. Then, they
can help. That is Prabhupada writes.

"A person engaged only in ministering to the physical welfare of human society
cannot factually help anyone."

Just as a person who does not know how to treat a patient, cannot really help.
Maybe, some encouragement can be given. But as far as the relieving the disease
is concerned, is not, is not be help. So:

"The real cause of one’s difﬁculties in the hard struggle for life may be found
in one’s forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord."

So, it is this forgetfulness that needs to be removed. And that is what the
"ṛṣi" does. So, now, Krishna talks about how such a person will eventually
attain liberation.

        kāma-krodha-vimuktānāṁ
        yatīnāṁ yata-cetasām
        abhito brahma-nirvāṇaṁ
        vartate viditātmanām

So, Krishna is repeatedly using the word "brahma-nirvāṇaṁ" over here. So,
spiritual liberation. So, "kā...". So, what are the re..., what is required for
that? "kāma-krodha-vimuktānāṁ". One is freed from "kāma" and "krodha".
"vimuktānāṁ". "muktā" is liberated. "vimuktā" is thoroughly liberated. So,
"kāma-krodha", where are these coming from? These two? Actually, we discussed
earlier how m..., m..., "kāma" and "krodha" are what Krishna talks about as the
c..., as the inner enemies. In 3.37. You know, when Arjuna asked in 3.36. What
is it that impells us to do wrong things? You know, then, Krishna replies, "kāma
eṣa krodha eṣa". So, "kāma" and "krodha" were coupled together at that time. Of
course, before that, also, you know, in 2.62-63, Krishna talked about how "kāma"
when frustrated leads to "krodha".

        dhyāyato viṣayān puṁsaḥ
        saṅgas teṣūpajāyate
        saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ
        kāmāt krodho ’bhijāyate

So, there, also, Krishna has talked about how, you know, they are connected. So,
when desire, when we have desire, desire becomes strong. It becomes lust. When
lust is obstructed or frustrated, then it becomes, a..., a..., anger, wrath. So,
now, Krishna has referred to these again in 5.23. In 5.23, you know, 5.22 was
that, you know, understand that sense pleasure leads to misery. "duḥkha-yonaya
eva te". Therefore, "na teṣu ramate budhaḥ". Do not engage in the sense
grat..., gratification. But now, in 5.24, He said, the, a, a, it means five
poi..., that was 5.22. So, 5.23 said that, therefore, tolerate. So, what was a,
what one has told it?

        śaknotīhaiva yaḥ soḍhuṁ
        prāk śarīra-vimokṣaṇāt
        kāma-krodhodbhavaṁ vegaṁ
        sa yuktaḥ sa sukhī naraḥ

So, again, "kāma" and "krodha" were coupled together. So, this coupling of
"kāma" and "krodha" is important. Because many people, they give, they, you
know, are able to control "kāma". But then, they cannot control "krodha". The
Bhagavatam says that, sometimes, the, you know, jnanis, they cross over the
ocean of lust. But then, they, you know, fall and drown in the puddle of
"krodha". So, now, nobody will drown in a puddle. Puddle is supposed to be very
small. But actually, you know, the point is that, th..., when one controls
"kāma". If the "kāma" is not purified. It is just, you know, it is just
suppressed. That means there is a constant battle of wills going on. You know. I
want it. No. I will not do it. I want it. No, I won't do it. So, there is a
battle going on. You know. That battle creates an inner hardness. And inner
m..., we could say hardness and harshness. And then, because that is also
self-centered. I will do it. I will not do it. I will do it. I will not do it.
The, so, the bhaktas are focusing on Krishna. I will, I want to love Krishna. I
want to serve Krishna. I want to please Krishna. Therefore, I will do what will
please Him. And therefore, I will not do this. So, the focus for the devotee is
not on I. The focus is on Krishna. And that is why the inn..., that desire to
please Krishna crowds out. The desire to enjoy or the desire to renounce. So, if
the, as devotees, we are motivated by the de..., by the desire to renounce and
not the desire to serve. Then, you know, what is likely to happen is that we
will be, you know, m..., having a volcano-like eruption of some time or the
other. Because what will happen is, when we deny our own desires o..., our
material desires, of course. When we deny our material desires. You know, I am
givin..., wake up this. I am giving up this. I am, you know, I am controlling
myself so much. And still, so many things are going wrong. Still, this is
happening. That is happening. That is happening. And it is, it is some time
or the other, all that anger will boom. Explode like a volcano. A..., and that,
the coming, other, l..., hot love are coming out. You know, it can break our
relationships. It can wreak our bhakti, also. So, we see, this is in the
Bhagavatam. That we see in the, you know, in the Vedic scriptures in general.
The Bhagavatam contains references to it. We have Viśvāmitra Muni. You know.
When he was doing meditation. First, he was tempted by "kāma". And when he was
tempted by "kāma". He, He, so, Menaka came and seduced him. And then, he fell
prey to her. Then, he again did austerity. At that time, he was determined. Now,
I will not fall prey again. So, then, when Rambha came along, what happened? You
know, he, by he saw her coming. You know, first time, when Menaka came, he was
so captivated by her that if I got who he was and what he was doing. And he has
just, you know, become attracted to her. And started, you know, living with her.
And united with her. But when Rambha came, he understood what she was doing. And
he understood that she has been sent by Indra. And she has, she is plotting, you
know, his fall. So, when she came that way, he felt a rush of rat coming over
him. And he cursed it. So, now, what happened? When he did that, through that,
also. He lost his power.

So, ultimately, we want to direct our emotions towards Krishna. So, "kāma" and
"krodha", both direct our emotions away from Krishna. So, there, you know, both
in that sense can be obstacles. So, now, "krodha", anger is called as kāmānujā.
Anuja means younger borther. Like Lakshmana is called as Rāmānujā. And in
the Sri Sampradaya, like the Rāmānujācārya c..., is considered some kind of
manifestation of "Lakshmana". So, Rāmānujā. The younger brother of Rama. So,
similarly, krodha is called as kāmānujā. That means where "kāma" comes, sooner
or later, "krodha" will come. "krodha" will come. "ānujā" is a, is birth. "jā"
is to take birth. "ānu" is, you know, inferior, lower, and later. So, one who is
born later. After "kāma". So, in general, when one has to become ad...,
spiritually advanced, one has to become free "kāma" and "krodha".
"kāma-krodha-vimuktānāṁ". If one is free only from "kāma". Of course, that is
also a challenge. But if one is only free from "kāma", but not from "krodha".
That means, actually, the desire is not really getting redirected towards
Krishna. The desire is simply getting redirected in the same material arena.
That means what we want to do is, say, this is the material level of reality.
This is spiritual level of reality. So, we want to take our desire. And move it
from here and move it over here. So, from the material level to the spiritual
level. But when we do not redirect our desire towards the spiritual level, then
the desire simply shifts from one material object to another material object.
You know, there are some people who want to give up alcohol addiction. And they
are told that, you know, if you want to d..., eat something. Or drink something.
Taste something which feels good to you. You take chocolates. This is called
substitution therapy. But then, those people become addicted to chocolates. Now,
chocolates may not be as harmful as, you know, alcohol. But i..., that is really
no solution. It is just going from one material urge to another material urge.
It may be a, it may be a lesser of the two evils. But still, it does an evil.
So, as devotees, we do not want this kind of substitution of one material thing
with another material thing. We want purification. Purification means
replacement of the material with the spiritual. And this re..., this is not
actually a replacement. It is a rever..., it is a reversion. Reversion means we
re..., revert back to what we were originally. All of us are souls. And as
souls, we are meant to delight at the spiritual level of reality. So, we simply
revert back to the spiritual level of reality by the practice of spiritual
life. By purifying ourselves through sadhana-bhati. So,
"kāma-krodha-vimuktānāṁ". So, we become free from "kāma" and "krodha" by the
practice of sadhana-bhakti. And then, "yatīnāṁ yata-cetasām". "yata-cetasām"
means the "yatī" is controlled over the mind. So, Prabhupada translates here as
the mind. So, "mukt...", "cetasām" as the mind. "cetasām" can mean
consciousness. It can be the mind, also. So, here, Krishna is telling that if we
have to control "kāma" and "krodha". Now, "kāma" and "krodha", primarily
internal. E..., we, yo..., we, if we want to control them, it is not enough to
do that externally. We have to do it internally. So, I may say that I will not
indulge in lust. Or I will not vent out my anger. But that will not purify me.
Certainly, that, it is good to at least control oneself at a physical level. But
beyond that, we have to remove the anarthas even from the mental level. Because
as long as they are at the mental level, they will be prodding us. Pushing us.
Goading us. Punching us. Pinching us. In various ways, they will be tormenting
us to act devotee, act without the physical level, also. Therefore:

        kāma-krodha-vimuktānāṁ
        yatīnāṁ yata-cetasām

"yata-cetasām" is one is controlling the mind. And that is why it is so
important for us to remember Krishna. When we remember Krishna, then we redirect
our heart's desires from the material to the spiritual. Then, "abhito
brahma-nirvāṇaṁ". "abhito" means, you know, "abh...", assured in the near
future. In the near future. So, this again, another, another time, in the
Bhagavad Gita where Krishna is talking about soon. Not after very far. In the
Fourth Chapter, He has talked about this, hmm, in 4.39. He has, says:

        jñānaṁ labdhvā parāṁ śāntim
        acireṇādhigacchati

So, there, "acireṇā". "acireṇā" means not after a long time. Soon. So, a...,
c..., similarly, "abhito". Prabhu..., tran..., Prabhupada translates "abhitaḥ"
as in the near future. "abhito brahma-nirvāṇaṁ". In the spiritual realm, one
will attain liberation. Now, we have to un..., we may wonder why is Krishna
not referring to "mam" so much over here? He does refer to it. But not so much.
Because t..., right now, He is not talking about bhakti-yoga, directly. He is
building the Bhagavad Gita's thought flow towards bhakti-yoga. Now, of course,
all these verses, their principles can be applied even in the path of
bhakti-yoga. But these are generic spiritual principles. That means
understanding that, you know, we should not pursue outer pleasures. And we
should pursue inner pleasures. These are generic principles which apply to
karma-yogis, jnana-yogis, and bhakti-yogis. The means by which, you know, one
will try sense control. That will be different. So, we are talking about, you
know, controlling the senses from the bhakti perspective. You know. Fixing the
mind on Krishna. The jnanis will talk about it from a different way. They will
talk about naiti. Naiti. The karma-yogis will talk about it from a different
way. But these are generic spiritual principles that are being talked about. So,
Prabhupada's, you know, Prabhupada t..., says, goes so far to say that,
actually, what to speak of impersonalists and mayavadis, even those who are
outside the Vedic fold, like the sunnyavadis. The buddhists. And the jains. You
know, Prabhupada does not talk so much about the jains. But buddhists, he says.
Even the sunnyavadis. They all three agree that entanglement in material
desires is the cause of suffering. And one has to give up that entanglement. The
method of giving entanglement, you know, will be based on one's conception of
the positive spirit of the goal. So, when the goal is a positive spiritual
reality. When the goal is a loving and lovable person whom we can serve. Even
with our senses in this world. Then, the process of, you know, becoming free
from our material desires becomes easier. But still, it is for us to become
free. So:

        abhito brahma-nirvāṇaṁ
        vartate viditātmanām

So, "viditātmanām". Those who are trans..., you know, "vartate" means, the, it
is, that will be there soon for them. "viditātmanām". Those who are
self-realised. "ātmanām". Those who have actually turned to the level of atma.
So, now, Prabhupada ta..., you know, talks about this beautiful verse of how one
can become "yata-cetasām". So, he says, this is Bhāgavatam, 4.22.39:

        yat-pāda-paṅkaja-palāśa-vilāsa-bhaktyā
        karmāśayaṁ grathitam udgrathayanti santaḥ
        tadvan na rikta-matayo yatayo ’pi ruddha-
        sroto-gaṇās tam araṇaṁ bhaja vāsudevam

So, this is actually "Pṛthu Mahārāja". You know, this is in "Pṛthu Mahārāja"'s
section. And it is describing over here how that that Absolute Truth. You know,
"bhaja vāsudevam". Worship that Absolute Truth. So that, the conclusion of
the whole verse is "bhaja vāsudevam". Worship Lord Vasudeva. And what is the
rational? Why should one worship Lor..., Lord Vasudeva? That is described prior
to that. That Absolute Truth, that Vasudeva, s..., "yat-pāda-paṅkaja-palāśa".
So, th..., the lotus feet of the Lord, "yat-pāda-paṅkaja-palāśa-vilāsa-bhaktyā".
So, "vilāsa" means to delight. One should delight in the lotus feet of the Lord.
That how? "bhaktyā". That means the devotee chants. Dances, Sings. You know,
worships the deity. Hears the pastimes. And devotee is to delight in that.
Sometimes, some devotees think that renunciation means we should not feel
happiness. No. Actually, sometimes, we should, if we, i..., chant and dance. You
see that we should not chant and dance for our pleasure? Well, it should not be
that we should be chanting and dancing only for our pleasure. But it is not that
we are not meant to feel pleasure. That means that we should chant and dance in
a graceful way. Not in a sensuous way. You know. Not in obn..., certainly not in
obnoxious way. You know, but, you know, when p..., when the early days of the
movement. When the devotees were in Lower East Side. At that time, the hippies
would come. And some of them would dance. And when they would dance, then they
would dance in very sensuous ways exposing their body. And moving their hands.
And legs in a way whi..., would, which is, which would almost actually
provocative. So, once, one la..., one young girl was doing like that. And they
told, Pra..., devotees told Prabhupada. And Prabhupada told the mataji is, go
and to talk with that girl. And to get her to dress beautifully. And then, dress
properly. And then, she came. And then, she changed, participated in the kirtan.
Now, she, she had no, you know, mal intentions over there. It was just that, you
know, know, she was, first, hold, she had taken drugs. And then, she was hearing
the chanting. She just went off, flipped off, was not aware of what she was
doing. So, that, that kind of dancing, Prabhupada would not encourage. But it,
certainly, when we dance and sing. When we hear Krishna Katha, if we f...,
experience happiness, you know, that is good. That is where we need to
experience happiness. But the test of our devotion is that, even when we do not
experience happiness, we continue doing the activity. Some days, when I chant, I
feel that it is, you know, it is so, so tiresome. It is so boring. But still, I
continue. Why do I continue on? Because I know that this is the way I will
experience happiness. This is the way I will make spiritual advancement.
Therefore, this is what I will do. So, "vilāsa-bhaktyā". But devotee should
delight in the practice of bhakti. When that happens, "karmāśayaṁ grathitam
udgrathayanti santaḥ". "karmāśayaṁ". The forces of karma, the, the f..., the
desire for fruitive activities, the, the residual impressions in the mind which
impell us towards, you know, fruitive activities. "grathitam". They are deeply
bound. But "udgrathayanti". They become uprooted. "santaḥ". The saintly people.
They uproot them like that. And the wha..., how, this, there is no other way to
do it. What is the other way? "tadvan na rikta-matayo". "na rikta-matayo". You
know, those who try to empty therein, "matayo" means consciousness.
"rikta-matayo". Those who try to empty their mind. Do not think of that. Do not
think of that. Do not think of that. Do not think of that. Those who try to do
that. "na rikta-matayo". You know. "yatayo ’pi ruddha-". They, even if they
endeavor to empty the mind. They cannot do it. Because "sroto-gaṇās tam araṇaṁ
bhaja vāsudevam". "sroto-gaṇās". "sroto" refers here to waves. So, you know, if
somebody is in the coast. And that person decides, you know, I am going to make
the coast to dry. How is it possible? You know, we may dry the coast by throwing
the water back into the ocean. But if we start, for some time, some waves will
come. And again the coast will become wet. Again, we dry it up. Again, the coast
will come. Again, the waves will come. And it will make us wet. So, what is,
how is it possible? Actually, if we try to empty the mind, what is going to
happen is, you know, waves are going to come. Waves of sensual desires will
come. Either from the outside world. When we p..., when we pursue sense objects.
Or from the inside world. That means from our own memory. When our past mem...,
past recollections of, you know, sensual d..., indulgences, are, become our,
aroused for some reason or the other. So, they are like waves.

So, the waves can, you know, they will keep coming. And they will keep flooding
our consciousness. So, the o..., the only thing to do is, so, if we try to empty
our mind. No, I will not think of this. I will not think of this. No, but that
is what, thoughts will come up. Because impressions are there. The sense objects
are there, externally. And the images are there, internally. So, therefore, the
solution is not to make the mind empty. But to make the mind full. Instead o...,
make the mind full with Krishna. So, if I have a glass of water. And I do not
want water in the, you know, if I have a glass. Now, by default, the glass will
be filled with air. Now, if I do not want it to be filled with air. What do I
have to do? Ai..., air, go away. It is not going to work. I want, even if I
turn that, box, glass, upside down. Still, it will be filled with air. Then what
do I do? Then, I get some vacuum machine. You know, a..., a..., pull it out. And
make a vacuum inside the glass. But how long can I keep the vacuum? You know, as
soon as I, you know, a, the, give a little exposure to that. That vacuum will
get filled. And air will come inside. 30:22
