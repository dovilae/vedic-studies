Hare Krishna. Welcome to our Bhagavad Gita class. Today, we will begin with the
Bhagavad Gita, from, starting from chapter one onwards. And our goal will be to
try to complete the Bhagavad Gita in hundred classes. That will be approximately
seven verses per class. But because the first chapter does not have so much
philosophy, we will go a little faster in the first chapter. And then
afterwards, we will go little more slowly. So, let us begin with the first
chapter. Before we look at the first chapter, let us just have a look at some
general principles for understanding the Bhagavad Gita. So, these are broad
features of the Bhagavad Gita. Now, the Bhagavad Gita is often known as a
yoga-shastra. So, we discussed briefly the position of the Bhagavad Gita. Now,
from the Gita Mahatmya point of view. So, let us look at it further.
Significance of the Gita is that, it is Shruti in the Smriti. So, technically
speaking, it can be classified as Smriti. Why Smriti? We discussed in our
Isopanisad classes that there are two categories of Vedic literature, Shruti and
Smriti. So, the Vedas and the Upanishads, which are a part of the Vedas. The
Vedas have four parts. Brahmanas, Aranyakas, Upanishadas, and Samhitas. So,
those are the parts of the Vedas. So, those Vedas are considered Shrutis. That sound
vibration which is directly received from the Absolute. And Smriti refers to
that sound vibration when it is understood, internalised and expressed by the
great sages. Shruti is about hearing. Smriti is about... Shruti is about hearing
and transmitting. Smriti is about h..., after hearing, smriti, meditating,
contemplating, remembering, internalising, realising, and then expressing. So,
some people consider Smriti to be lower than Shruti. Because the Smriti is said
to be not the direct revelation of God. But it is the understanding of the
acharyas, understanding of the sages. That is true in one sense from the
technical perspective. But scripture is not just a book of body that is s...,
mere anthology of text. It is a symphony of revelations. That is past not just
through the medium of the texts, but also the medium of the hearts. So,
scripture is understood through not just the text, but also the examples of
those who are living according to text. So, therefore, the Smriti is actually in
many senses considered to be more important because there the scriptural wisdom
is made accessible, made comprehensible, is made relishable by the realisations
of the great sages. So, therefore, Smriti is not really lower. In fact, there
are scriptural statements which also say that without studying the Smriti,
Shruti cannot be understood. The education of Shruti is not complete without
education of Smriti. So, so even if we from a technical point of view say that
Smirit is lower, but still if we look at the definitional point of view, from
that point of view of textual classification, the Bhagavad Gita comes in the
Smriti as it is mentioned over here. That is in the Mahabharata, the Bhisma
Parva, the Sixth Parva, which is the, of the Mahabharata. And in that, it is in
chapter 25 to 42. Now, there are two primary renditions of the Mahabharata. And
in some chap..., some sections of Mahabharata, the chapters 23 to 40 also. But
the point essentially is that, the, it is eighteen chapters from the Mahabharata
within the Bhisma Parva. And within the Bhishma Parva, when it is positioned
over here, the important point to understand is that from the definitional point
of view, the essential definition of Shruti is that which is the word of God.
And Krishna Himself is God. So, Shruti refers to that which is the word of God,
which is heard by the stages. And Bhagavad Gita is the word of God, which is
heard by Arjuna, which is heard by Sanjaya, which is heard by Dhritarashtra. So,
it is, it is also Shruti in that sense. So, Shruti within Smriti. So, w...,
although, in the Prasthana Traya. In the Prasthana Traya, "traya" refers to the
three pillars of establishing authoritative teachings, Shruti, Smriti and Nyaya.
Bhagavad Gita comes in the Smriti. That is how the acharyas explained it. But
still, the Padma Purana does say that the Bhagavad Gita is the essence of all
the Upanishads. And in that sense, it is of critical important for the overall
internationalisation of the message of the scriptures.

So, now, let us look at some further features of the Gita. We see here, st...,
look at, look at, we will look at statistical features of the Gita. That means,
statistical features means, from, from the point of view of, what may, how many
verses are about what topics. So, in the Bhagavad Gita, there are 575 verses
that are spoken by Krishna, "sri bhagavan uvaca". Then, there are 83 verses
spoken by Arjuna. And most of Arjuna's verses come in Chapter One and Eleven.
And the remaining verses, all of them, there are just 28 verses in 12 other
chapters. And in some verses, there are no, in some chapters, there are no
verses by Arjuna. And Sanjaya s..., San..., speaks 41 verses, which are mostly
in chapter one, and other chapters also, "sanjaya uvaca" also comes in two,
eleven and eighteen. And Dhritarashtra speaks one verse which begins the
Bhagavad Gita. So, in this way, the 700 verses are there. Now, sometimes we say
that the Bhagavad Gita is spoken by Krishna. Which is true. But now we will see
over here by, from this numerical point of view that 125 of these verses are not
spoken by Krishna. So then, is it correct to say that the Bhagavad Gita is
spoken by Krishna? So, Baladeva Vidyabhushana analyses this. And he explains
that just as, he gives, he gives it by proximity shapes quality. So, he says
that, the essential message of the Gita is the message that Krishna has given.
And everything around that is just the context that immediately and powerfully
brings out the relevance, the necessity, the importance of that message. So,
because Krishna's words are transcendental and the surrounding words of the
Gita, which preface, or which succeed Krishna's verses, they are, provide the
context of a proximity to Krishna's wo..., words. They also acquire
transcendental characteristic. So, in the technical point of view, they are not
sp..., remaining 125 verses of the Gita are not spoken by Krishna. But from the
overall point of view that they also contribute to the transmission of Krishna's
message. So, they are also set to be in a sense potent, in a sense
transcendental. So, we consider the recitation of the whole Bhagavad Gita
purifying. It is not that when "dhritarashtra uvaca", oh, Dhrtarastra, or the
attached person. So, if I say Dhrtarastra and I recite his verse, I will not
become purified. Oh, I should only find out which verses in the Bhagavad Gita
"sri bhagavan uvaca". And I will recite only the verses. I will not recite other
verses. No, this is parochial attitude. This is a short sighted attitude because
we, we understand that Krishna's words, the purification is not just the recitation.
Yes, recitation is extremely important for those who are inclined to do it. And
all of us can recite verses for purification. We will discuss in the seventeenth
chapter how Krishna says this one of the austerities of speech, by which our
speech becomes austere and pure. But along with that, Krishna also wants to
convey meanings. And the meanings are understood with the context. That is why
we consider the recitation of all the verses of Gita purifying. So, so it is not
in a technical sense that Krishna spoke all the seven hundred verses. But in the
overall sense, all the seven hundred verses contribute to the meanings spoken
by, the essential message spoken by Krishna. Now, same applies actually to
Srimad Bhagavatam also. It is not that whole Srimad Bhagavatam was spoken by
Sukadeva Goswami. Sukadeva Goswami in fact appears in the Second Canto, First
Chapter. Or rather, his first verse appear in the Second Canto, First Chapter.
He appears in the last Chapter of the First Canto. That is 19th Chapter. And
then after that, he starts speaking in the next Canto. But still, the point is
that because it all, the, what has been spoken earlier is contributing to the
message. So, therefore, it is said the whole Srimad Bhagavatam is spoken by
Sukadeva Goswami. Sometimes, it is said. Now, when Krishna speaks, He covers a
wide variety of topics in the Bhagavad Gita. And His purpose is to establish the
best sadhya and the best sadhna, the topmost sadhya, the topmost sadhana.

Another feature of the Gita is that there are many names which are used to
address. And Arjuna is addressed by over twenty other names. And Krishna is
addressed by thirty-three other names. So, this indicates, the names indicate
various specific significant points. That means the acharyas explained that in a
particular context, when a particular name is used, that context helps us to
understand the significance of that name. But beyond that also, overall, the
context helps us to, the names indicate the personal nature of the
reciprocation. You know, if both of them are just es..., temporary
manifestations of Brahman. So, I am Brahman. You are brahman. And all names are
illusion. Then, there is no need for one Brahman to refer to another Brahman by
so many different names which are all basically forms of illusion. And
the purpo..., the, especially, this will be all the more true, when the
discussion is based on talking about how to go from illusion to light. "Tamaso
mƒÅ jyotir gamaya", that is the Upanishad's di..., message. And that is
demonstrated in the Bhagavad Gita. Because Arjuna is overwhelmed by illusion.
And Krishna helps him come out of illusion. So, this indicates the 11:33
