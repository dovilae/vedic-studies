Hare Krishna.

	loka-trayopakaraya, tasmai krsnatmane namah

Hare Krishna.

So, today, we continue with the first chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. We discussed
till verses four, verse fourteen yesterday. So, first, Bhish..., you know,
Duryodhana spoke, assessing the strength of both the armies. Then, Bhishma blew
his conchshell. The remaining Kauravas blew their conchshells. And now, Krishna
and Arjuna, the focus is on them. And they are blowing their conchshell. So, let
us look at the verse. Let us see here.

        pāñcajanyaṁ hṛṣīkeśo
        devadattaṁ dhanañ-jayaḥ
        pauṇḍraṁ dadhmau mahā-śaṅkhaṁ
        bhīma-karmā vṛkodaraḥ

So, both of them are blowing their conchshells. "pāñcajanyaṁ hṛṣīkeśo". Lord
Hṛṣīkeśa blew his Pāñcajanya, his conchshell. And Dhanañjaya is Krishna...,
is Arjuna. And he blew his conchshell, named Devadatta. And then similarly,
"pauṇḍraṁ dadhmau mahā-śaṅkhaṁ". So, the giant "śaṅkhaṁ", "mahā-śaṅkhaṁ". You
know, Bhīma himself was giant-bodied. His strength was like that of a giant. And
his paraphernalia was also like that of a giant. So, "mahā-śaṅkhaṁ", his
conchshell was giant. So, "pauṇḍraṁ dadhmau", and its name was Pauṇḍra.
"bhīma-karmā vṛkodaraḥ". So, "Bhīma", the name itself means her..., let us say,
hercules. One who is extremely strong. So, in English, there is a word called
Herculean. So, Hercules is a character from the Greek tradition. Greek or Roman
tradition. And there, the idea is of a person who could get giant strength. And
he could do huge amount of work. So, many of the characters in the Greek or
Roman tradition, they are derivatives from the Vedic tradition. And in fact, if
we look at the thoughts of Socrates. You know, When Socrates' brother, Socrates'
friend's wife passes away. And his wif..., brother is lamenting, Socrates
consorts him by giving five reasons for the immortality of the soul. And those
reasons are practically identical with the first chap..., with the second
chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. Where Krishna is telling Arjuna about the
immortality of the soul. So, basically, after the Kurukṣetra war, from the
Indian mainland, there were expatriates. You know, which went away. People who
left the country. And they went to various parts, settled down in various part.
And they, they were settled in various parts. But over the centuries as the
power of the Kurukṣetra king, power of the king of Hastinapur became weaker
and weaker, the connection with the parent culture became more tenuous. And then
some local cultural derivatives also came out. That is why there are
similarities between the Vedic culture and the other cultures of the world. And
there are differences also. So, the Vedic patriarchs considered the Greek or
Roman culture to be an expatriate Vedic civilisation. Srila Prabhupada was
tal..., talks about this. And it is mentioned in līlāmṛta also. So, you know,
he, "bhīma-karmā", so, his name is Bhīma. But he was, karma was also Bhīma. And
here, he is referred to as, not by the name of Bhīma. He is referred to by
another name, "vṛkodaraḥ". "udaraḥ" means stomach. And then, "udaraḥ", "vṛka" is
giant, huge. So, "vṛka-udaraḥ" refers to, as Prabhupada translated, voracious
eater. So, voracious eater. Now, Bhīma, he was extremely powerful. And now,
power does not come out of thin air. You know, a person who does a lot of
powerful work, need, gets that power by eating. So, after Draupadī's svayaṃvara
was performed, in which Arjuna won her hand. And then, they came back. And when
they came back, then Arjuna told her, his mother Kuntī was waiting anxiously. He
says I have got a special gift for you. So, he said, so, Kuntī, she was doing
her prayers. And without looking, she says, whatever you have got, share it with
your brothers. And take it. So, he was shocked. He did not know what to do. All
of them were stunned. And seeing the numb silence. And seeing the numb silence
behind her, Kuntī turned and asked, what is the matter? And then, she saw
Draupadī. You know, princesses dressed in the royal, robes of, for the occasion
of marriage. He says, I have got a bride for you. I have got a wife. He says,
they are all shocked. That Kuntī said that, you know, my words have never been
false.

And Yudhiṣṭhira also started thinking about it. And then, he said, some, I have
never contaminated sinful activity. But unless I feel that, what you have just,
what you have said should be done. And then afterwards, there is a long story.
Vasudeva also came there. And Vasudeva also said that actually, Draupadī had
performed austerity in a previous life. And she had, was desperate for a
husband. So, when Lord Shiva appeared, she asked Lord Shiva. I want a husband. I
want a husband. I want a husband. I want a husband. I want a husband. She said
five times. Lord Shiva said because you asked five times, you will get five
husbands, next life. And then, Drupada was also convinced. And then, basically,
the marriage wa..., the, with all the five was done. But the important point for
our context is, so, when Draupadī had come there, then Kuntī trained Draupadī.
You know, how, now, you should serve your husbands. So, how should you serve
them? How to serve the Pandavas? He says, whatever food we get, you know, if,
divide it into two parts. And take one part, and then divide it into fou...,
five, we were dividing it into five parts, now, we will divide it into six
parts. So, one part for each of the four Pandavas. One part for you. And one
part for me. And, so like that. And the one giant part, she says half part, that
is for Bhīma. So, Draupadī could not resist the smile. So, that is how, now,
actually, Bhīma was "bhīma-karmā vṛkodaraḥ". He was, he used to eat a lot. And,
you know, his appetite was giant. But then work, he do was tremendous also. When
they, Kauravas would be, when, when the Kauravas had conspired to how the
Pandavas burnt in Varanavartha, in the house of lac. So, at night, through a
tunnel, on, before the house was burnt, the Pandavas escaped. You know, when
they came to the forest, the wilderness, they were making their way alone. You
know, the five of them were there, b..., the six of them were there along with
their mother, the five Pandavas. They are just making their struggling along.
So, at that time, they became exhausted. So, what did Bhīma do? Bhīma said, all
of you sit on my shoulders. So, he took his four brothers as well as mother. He
got all of them to sit on his shoulders. And he started running. You know,
actually, the others were stumbling on branches and other things. When he was
running, whatever was there, it would just break apart. And he would keep
running. So, when it came to work, also, he did tremendous work. So, he was very
very energetic. So, different people depending on their capacity, depending on
their nature, their body, so, body type, their kind of work, even people may eat
in different amounts of food. You know, sometimes, if we are eating less. And
somebody is eating more, we should not think that I am more sense-controlled.
That person is less sense-controlled. You know, it is not so much the quantity
that a person eats, but is the consistency. It, just because today, was a nice
food, I eat a giant quantity. And next day, I eat, because I do not like it,
very less. Then, that sort of alternation, just naturally, something is real...,
at, to our taste, we may take a little more than usual. But if we are just
alternating depending on the taste, and then, then that is more of like a sense
control. Some person, on a regular basis, that person needs a, more food. That
is not necessarily lack of sense control. You know, in the Vaishnava culture, we
also have Raghunatha Goswami who eats once in three days. Who take a little bit
food. You know, take just some butter milk, two or three days. And we have
Bhīma. Bhīma, who would eat so much. And for Bhīma, fasting was nearly
impossible. And it is, actually, this whole Pandava Nirjala Ekādaśī, it, it, we
get it because of the kindness of Bhīma. And it is not the kindness of Bhīma. It
is the giant appetite of Bhīma. Bhīma told Vasudeva who was like his
grandfather, you know, in a sense, in that, actually.

He was Pandu's, Pandu's father. So, generally speaking, you know, because the,
so this was a particular system in the Vedic culture. That if the woman, the
dynasty has to go on. And if a woman in a dynasty does not have a husband, then
the brother-in-law can impregnate her. But when the brother-in-law impregnates
her, actually, that brother-in-law, the offspring that are born, are not
considered to be the sons of that brother-in-law. They are considered to be her
sons. And they are considered to be descendents of the deceased husband. So,
the, if the brother-in-law, the, he is inseminating, so that is just as a, the
dynasty can go on. Then, it is not considered that the brother-in-law is the
father. So, that is why, in the Mahabharata, although it was Vasudeva through
whom, Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Pandu are born. Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Pandu do not refer to
Vasudeva as father. Nor do the Pandavas refer to him as grandfather. Because
that is a contin..., that is a, it is a contingent arrangement. It is a, because
of an emergency, that particular arrangement has been done. And there is, the
focus is not so much on, in modern times, this idea may seem controversial. You
know, it may seem scandalous also. How can a brother-in-law inseminate his, his
bro..., bro..., his brother's, brother's wife? But the point is that in our
culture, the focus is too much on lust and sex. In the past, the V..., lust and
sex have always been a part of human culture, an important part, quite a, a,
quite a significant part. But nowadays, it is dominant, predominant in fact. And
because of that, all relationships, we just cannot, many people cannot think of
anything beyond the carnality of those relationships. But in the earlier
culture, the dynasty was very important. And continuing the dynasty was also a
very important function. So, the focus in this thing is not on the immorality or
the sensuality. You know, there was just one-time contact between Vasudeva and
Amba..., Ambikā and Ambālikā. And after that, there is no other contact at all.
And Vasudeva also did not con..., he, nobody considers him to be contaminated.
Vasudeva is still respected as a great sage, as the author of the Vedas, now, as
the au..., compiler, the purposefully put and written form of the Vedic
literature. And, he, the, Ambikā and Ambālikā are not considered unchaste in any
way. The point in this is the continuation of the dynasty. So, although, from
the seminal point of view, we could say that, Vasudeva is the grandfather of the
Pandavas. But they never referred to him that way. They referred to him
primarily as a great sage. And they respect him accordingly. So, Bhīma tells
V..., Vasudeva. Vasudeva is telling, extolling the glories of Ekādaśī. See, how
you must fast on Ekādaśī. So, Bhīma says it is impossible. He says I cannot
fast. What to speak of fast a whole day? Even for one minute, the next minute is
difficult for me. I feel so hungry. Imagine a lot of work also. So, then, he
says, no, but you must fast. He says, then please, arrange for, you know, one
Ekādaśī where if I fast. I can fast once a year. Fast, then please arrange that
I will get the benefit of all the Ekādaśīs. So, then, Vasudeva says, yes.
Vasudeva has that potency. And then, he says, this is a special Ekādaśī. And he
fast on this particular Ekādaśī. Then, by fasting on the one Ekādaśī, you will
get the benefit of fasting on all of the rains of the year, all of the Ekādaśīs
of the year. That is how the Pandava Nirjala Ekādaśī has originated.

So, the point again is "bhīma-karmā vṛkodaraḥ". He used to be a giant eater. And
Prabhupada elaborates on the names Hṛṣīkeśa and Dhanañjaya over here. So,
Krishna is the controller of the senses. What does it mean He is the controller?
Now, there are two l..., levels of meaning to that. One, He is objectively
always the controller. And the other is, subjectively, we accept Him as a
controller. And then we voluntarily agree to be controlled by Him. So,
objectively means, right now, I am speaking. So, I think, I am speaking. And I
have the power to speak. But suppose, I develop a bad throat. Then, I have, I
still, I am still sitting here. My throat is also here. But I will lose the
power to speak. So, objectively, it is through reality that my senses are not
under my control. Although, my senses are, I call them as mine. And although
frequently, I am able to control them. But at the same time, there are times
when I am not able to control them. Sometimes, people get paralysis. And then,
when they get paralysis, they just cannot control any of their limbs. You know,
people may get Parkinson's and diseases like that. So, therefore, the point here
is that we have limited powers. And even those powers can be taken away at any
time. So, Krishna is, objectively speaking, the controller. And based on our
past karma, he gives us certain level of control over our body and our senses.
And, so, now, our perfection is to recognise the objective reality. And then
subjectively, accept Krishna as the controller. That means, Krishna, you are my 
master. And my senses are yours. I am meant to be yours. So, please, engage me
in your service. Please accept me as your servant. So, when we understand this
and accept this principle, then we are moving towards spiritual reality. So,
that is how, you know, this definition of bhakti is:

        hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-
        sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate

"ucyate". "hṛṣīkeṇa", with our senses, we serve the Lord and the senses. Then,
there is "Pāñcajanya". There is a whole story in the Bhagavatam about how the
demon, "Pāñcajanya", and Krishna killed him. And then, his bo..., he was in the
form of a conch. He had a conch with him. Which is like his defining
characteristic. And Krishna took that conch. Now, this is just a hystorical
narrative. When Krishna appeared how He got the conch. But actually, conch is
His eternal associate. And it is also, it, paraphernalia. It is always there in
the spiritual world with Him. But when He appears in this world, there is a
particular, hystorical narrative, by which, His, His associate comes and meets
Him. And His paraphernalia becomes His. Now, Arjuna is called as Dhanañjaya.
Dhanañjaya means one who gets Dhana, one who has acquired Dhana. So, actually,
when Yudhiṣṭhira Maharaja wanted to perform a big yajña. So, he needed, yajñas
are expensive affairs. You need a lot of gold for it. So, he went to the North
and searched in the remote areas, and found a lot of gold over there. And that
is how he got the name, Dhanañjaya. And in the context of the Bhagavad Gita,
we will see that by through Krishna's instructions, he also got the Dhana, the
know..., wealth of spiritual knowledge. That is also the ultimate wealth. So,
let us look at the next verse. Now, after describing this, now the remaining
kings are described, remaining people who blow their conchshells.

        anantavijayaṁ rājā
        kuntī-putro yudhiṣṭhiraḥ
        nakulaḥ sahadevaś ca
        sughoṣa-maṇipuṣpakau

        kāśyaś ca parameṣv-āsaḥ
        śikhaṇḍī ca mahā-rathaḥ
        dhṛṣṭadyumno virāṭaś ca
        sātyakiś cāparājitaḥ

        drupado draupadeyāś ca
        sarvaśaḥ pṛthivī-pate
        saubhadraś ca mahā-bāhuḥ
        śaṅkhān dadhmuḥ pṛthak pṛthak

So:

        anantavijayaṁ rājā
        kuntī-putro yudhiṣṭhiraḥ

So, it is interesting that on the Pandavas' side, first Krish..., Krishna and
Arjuna are described. Then, Bhīma is described. And after that, Yudhiṣṭhira is
described. Although, Yudhiṣṭhira is the king. From the point of view of
significance on the battlefield, the most influential warriors, first of all,
was Arjuna and Krishna, the combination. Then, the most, the second most
influential was Bhīma. And then after that was Yudhiṣṭhira. And then Nakula. So,
his conchshell was "anantavijayaṁ". And similarly, Nakula and Sahadeva had their
conchshells, Sughoṣa and Maṇipuṣpaka. 17:06
