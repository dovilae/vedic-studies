	sarathyam arjunasyadau, kurvan gitamrtam dadau 
	loka-trayopakaraya, tasmai krsnatmane namah

Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are
now into the Fifth Chapter. We discussed the first seven verses of the Fifth
chapter. This Fifth Chapter. Let us have a quick overview once again before we
move forward. And look at the sections. So, the first section was kal...,
karma-yoga is equal to, but easier than jnana-yoga. Then, we are now discussing
how karma-yoga keeps a person free from bondage. That is second section, seven
to sixteen. But by fixing the mind on atma, karma-yogi stays free from bondage.
So, seventh verse, we discussed was "kurvann api na li...":

        sarva-bhūtātma-bhūtātmā
        kurvann api na lipyate

Let us go to the eigth to nine verse now. These are, two are clocked together by
Srila Prabhupada:

        naiva kiñcit karomīti
        yukto manyeta tattva-vit
        paśyañ śṛṇvan spṛśañ jighrann
        aśnan gacchan svapañ śvasan

        pralapan visṛjan gṛhṇann
        unmiṣan nimiṣann api
        indriyāṇīndriyārtheṣu
        vartanta iti dhārayan

So, "naiva kiñcit karomīti". "naiva". Certainly not. "kiñcit". Even a little.
"karomi", "iti". I am doing. "karomi" means I am doing. I do. "iti". One does
not think like this. So, one doe..., th..., the "yukto manyeta tattva-vit".
"tattva-vit" is the person who is the knower of the truth. Such a person
"manyeta". Such a person thinks what? That person is well-engaged, does not
think, thi..., you know, thinks that I am not the doer of anything. And what are
the things which are, He is talking about? "paśyañ śṛṇvan spṛśañ jighrann". So,
these are actions of the various senses. So, first, there are the senses which
take things in word. And kno..., knowledge acquiring sense. "paśyañ" is seeing.
"śṛṇvan" is hearing. "spṛśañ" is touching. "jighrann" is smelling. "aśnan" is
eating. So, these are the ways in which we take things inside the body. And
then, "gacchan" is going here and there. "gacchan svapañ śvasan". "śvasan".
"svapañ" is, you know, "svapañ" is sleeping, dreaming. "śvasan" is the, m...,
s..., breathing. Then, "pralapan". "pralapan" is talking. "visṛjan" is giving
up. "gṛhṇann" is accepting. So, these are the various ways in which we can take
things inside the body. And send things outside the body. "unmiṣan nimiṣann
api". "unmiṣan" is closing the eyes. Opening the eyes.

        indriyāṇīndriyārtheṣu
        vartanta iti dhārayan

So, "dhārayan". What does one understand? The, "yuk...", "tattva-vit", the
person one is a knower understands that simply the senses are coming in contact
with the sense objects. Nothing more is happening. So, actually, you know, what
is Krishna telling over here? That the wise person understands that when so many
things happen with the body, I am not actually the doer of those things. We may
think I am the body. For example, I think I am speaking right now. And I am
using this body for doing various things. Now, at one level, it is true. I am
speaking. But that is hardly the complete picture. You know, a, modern scien...,
we will understand this at different levels. We will first understand at a
scientific level. Then, we will understand it at a philosophical level. So, if
we look at scientific level, you know, in the body, there i..., there are
different kinds of activities that happen. So, there are some activities which
we do consciously. For example, now, I want to s..., you know, explain something
with an expression, then I will raise my hand. Or I will move my hand. These
are a, things which I do consciously. And then, there is something which happen
unconscious..., subconsciously in the body. For example, while I am speaking, I
do not forget to breathe. You know, I, I, it is not that I have to remember to
f..., breathe. It is just that it happens subconsciously. So, now, you know,
there are various kinds of diseases in the body. Where sometimes in so..., in
some people because of some brain damage or some nervous tissue damage. The
nervous system damage. The peop..., the people, there, there, whatever is
happening, you know, involuntarily in the body. That, they do not, they cannot
make it happen. That means whatever happens involuntarily in the body, they, you
know, it does not happen involuntarily. They have to do it consciously. For
example, there is a disease. When people, you know, they, they stop breathing.
If they are not conscious about it. That will consciously remind. Oh, I have to
breathe. And this, these people, whenever they fall asleep, you know, they will
die of, you know, breathlessness if they swal..., fall asleep. Because their
body in a sense, because of some damage to the, a, a, nervous system, the sys..,
ped..., the involuntarily nervous system. They just, the body forgets to
breathe. It is a nightmarish kind of disease. That the person just cannot sleep.
And there are, in some cases, people, they, they have to, every time they sleep,
they have to put in artificial neural system, artificial respiratory system. And
only then, they can breathe. And similar, the aritificial respiratory system, if
it does not work, then the body will forget to sleep. And they will, in their
sleep, only, they will die. And no one will come to know about them, only. They
will, so, not realise it at all. So, now, resea..., researchers have found out
that if we had to be consciously aware so that the various bodily functions
could happen, then we would have such an overload on our brain that we would
become dysfunctional. We would not be able to do anything. For example, when we
eat food, we do not, you know, we may have to remind ourselves, ok, I have to
chew it. Like that, also happens most of the time con..., a, subconsciously
only. And generally, if we forget it, we will just gulp the food down very fast.
We will not be very conscious of its taste. But either way, the food goes down
the body. After that, what happens? After that, nobody knows what happens
actually? We do not know at least. Some researchers may know. But now, if we had
to remember, oh, now, the food is going down the alimentary canal. Now, of, the
alimentary canal has to compress. Then, it has to expand. Then, it has to
compress. Then, it has to expand. And then, a, the, when the appropriate
reactions have to happen in the stomach. If we had to be conscious of all these
things, we would not be able to be conscious of anything else in life. You know,
if we had to be conscious about breathing, about digestion, about blood
circulation. Oh, heart, now, you must beat. Now, compress. Now, expand. Now,
compress. Now, expand. And that is how the blood will go all over the body. Now,
if we had to be conscious of all these things, we would have a tremendous
overload on our brain. You know. So, it is a great relief that we do not have to
be conscious about all these things. But how do these things happen? So, I
understand the, they, this automatically happening. Actually, we discussed
earlier how automatically simply means that we do not know who is in control and
how that, how that control is happening. But that doe..., a, it does not mean
absen..., automatically does not mean absence of control. Automatically simply
means absence of awareness of control. You know. Absence of awareness of
control. So, who is controlling? Actually, it is, Supersoul is controlling.

        mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ

"mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ. So, actually, even through sci..., a, "maya...", that
is, refers to 9.10 in the Bhagavad Gita where Krishna says I am the controller.
So, in this way, if we think deeply, there is so much in our own body that is
happening that is not a..., a..., although it is necessary for it to be done so
that the body can function, but it happens without our conscious awareness. So,
we are not even aware of it. In fact, you know, we eat food. And we enjoy the
taste if it is good. And we curse the taste if it is bad. But afterwards, who
does the digestion? You know, actually, the only time we think about our
digestion is when it does not work. You know, my stomach is upset today. Why is
the ups..., stomach upset? So, practically, the only time we think about
digestion is when it does not work. But at other times, when the digestion does
work, at that time, what happens? We do not even think about it. So, who is
doing all this? It is not actually we who are doing it. It, so, with respect to
these things, we can say that, I am not the doer. You know, the, also, there,
so, actually, science tells us how much we, how much is happening in the body
for which we are not the doers. So, "naiva kiñcit karomīti". I am not doing any
of these things. We can say this. So, to some extent, science makes us aware of
th..., our own ignorance with respect to the complexity of the mechanisms by
which the body works and repairs itself. You know, when a wound happens, you
know, we might just decide, ok, I will put some thermodel. I will put some
band-aid. I will put some antiseptic. That is all that we do. But what does our
medication do? The medication basically would be useless if there would not be
an inbuilt healing process that ablibeses are there in the body. The clotting
takes place in the body. So, if these mechanisms were not there, then the body
would not be able to function. And our, or medication primarily assists the body
in healing itself. These are, doctor was, said that, you know, most of medicine
is essentially entertaining the patient while the body heals itself. So, most of
medicine is what? Entertaining the patient. Told the la..., patient, too
worried. Ah, this will go down. That will go down. Just, they will be alright.
Take, keep taking these medicines. So, actually, the medicines are not the
primary cure. The body's own healing system is the primary cure. The medicines
do help. No doubt. And we should take the medicines ca..., responsibly. Because
the body's healing system may need some assistance at times. But the medicines
would not be of much help if the body's healing system itself are not working.
And that is what happens at, sometimes when diseases like AIDS. When people get
AIDS, at that time, the immune system, tha..., that is there. The immun...,
immunodiffusion s..., immunodiffusion system of the body, that stops working.
And then, what happens it, a, any small infection can turn out to become lethal
and then fatal. So, beco..., a, so, actually, the body's defense mechanism
itself collapses, then medicines can go only so far in helping the person. They
cannot help b..., beyond a particular point. Because a body's defense mechanism
itself has collapsed. So, that way, we can say there is so much in the body for
which we are not the doers. "naiva kiñcit karomīti". You know. You know. Now,
beyond what happens at a sub..., at an unconscious level, at what other their
in..., co..., at an involuntarily level, even what are the, happen at the
voluntarily level, we are not always in control.

You know, for example, I am moving my hand right now. So, now, if suppose, I get
an ache. Or I get a paralysis. Then, I find move my hand. I am here. My hand is
here. But I cannot move it. Or sometimes, people get some disease like
Parkinson's. And when they get the disease, then what happens is, the, the, one
loses control over one's motor nervous system. That time, also, we can
understand, wha..., I am not the doer. I thought I was moving my hand around. But I
have losed the..., lost that power. So, now, when we say, oh, those are natural
conditions. Naturally, we are the doers. But in certain unnatural conditions, we
stop being the doers. However, our living in the body itself is temporary. So,
when our staying in the body is temporary. Our association with the body is
temporary. Within that temporary association with the body, for some time, we
are able to do some things. You know, for some time, we are not able to do some
things. So, what essentially is the, you know, difference. Wha..., how do we
say that one is natural, one is unnatural? You know, both things happen. And
yes, majo..., for majority of people, the things may not happen. But that does
not mean that they are the doer. That simply means that the system is in place
by which the illusion that they are the doers can continue. And when the system,
you know, changes its way of functioning, then that they cannot continue the
illusion. So, that is all at a scientific level. Now, looking at a philosophical
level, they can understand that the material nature is working. Now, I as a soul
do not really have much to do with the body. I am just currently in a body. You
know, person may be in a, a soul may be in non-human body. And then, comes to
human body. And may that, after that, go, again go back to non-human body. So,
the soul in a, say, dog's body cannot do anything except bark. If it wants to
communicate. It cannot speak any, any of the human languages. So, how do I, if I
am in a human body. And next life, I have to again go to a dog's body. Or I go
to a horse's body where I am going to neigh. So, how do I produce that
particular sound? I do not know anything about it. It is just that along with
that body, "śarīra-bandhaḥ". You know. "śarīra-yogaṁ". When we become mounted in
the body. When we get connected with the body. Whatever are the faculties that
are associated with the body, the soul starts expressing its desires according
to those faculties. So, actually, you know, that means the body is a mechanism.
And becau..., according to that mechanism, people work. So, when we understand
this, then we understand that, actually, I am not the doer. I am not the doer.

        indriyāṇīndriyārtheṣu
        vartanta iti dhārayan

Let us try to understand this concept of doership more. So, now, if we look at
this point of who is the doer. So, we have discussed this briefly earlier. But
let us focus on this now. If the soul is not the doer, it raises several
questions. Whose reactions is the soul getting? And whom are the scriptures
meant for? So, if it were the absolute statement the soul is not the doer at
all, then if the soul is not the doer, then the soul should not be the reaper of
the reactions, also. Yet, we said it the soul will get the reactions, isn't it?
M..., m..., we said that the soul gets the reactions. And the scriptures also
consider soul to be responsible. Scriptures say, you should do this. You should
not do this. So, the point is not to say that the soul is not absolutely, is, in
absolute sense, a non-doer. The point is to convey that,  the soul is not the
karta means, the soul is not the "svatantra karta", is not an independent doer.
Not an independent doer. Soul is a dependent doer. Soul works in coordination
with other elements. Let us understand this with an example. Soul is not the
independent doer. How is it not the independent doer? Let us look at it. So,
now, we will discuss this. If the tree is the karta, sorry, the tree is cut.
A..., Axe is the instrumental cause. And woodcutter is the initiating cause. So,
both causes are important. For actions, in the world, prakrti, material nature,
is the instrumental cause. And jiva is the initiating cause. So, you know, if a
soul is in a human body, then a soul is in a dog's body, in a human body, and
then goes into a horse's body. So, now, the, the soul is the initiating cause.
Say, the soul wants to communicate something. So, now, that, c..., soul is the
initiating cause with the desire to communicate. But the instrumental cause is
different. So, in a dog, the dog's voice box is different. The human being's
voice bok is difference. And the horse's voice box is d..., voice box is
difference. So, therefore, the sound that comes out will be different. So, the
instrumental cause is different. So, when a, somebody want to cut a tree, now,
somebody may use an axe. Somebody may use a machine axe. And somebody may use a
tree. A..., somebody, so, some may use a huge, a, bulldozer sort of thing which
just, you know, plows down trees. That may vary. So, the instrumental cause can
be different. And the way, the action will work out will be different
accordingly. So, we have been given a particular instrument. And this instrument
that is primarily acting. Although, our desire is the initiator. But it is the
instrument that is the executor. So, now, moving forward with this poi...,
understanding, another example is, now, when the criminal is put into jail. When
the criminal is put in jail, who is the doer at that time? The police is the
instrumental cause. The judge is the sanctioning cause. And the criminal is the
initiating cause. So, now, all three are involved. Isn't it? So, if there is, if
the criminal had not done a wrong, then the criminal would not have gotten into
jail. So, the criminal is the initiating cause. But even after the criminal does
something, it is the police who have to arrest. So, the police are the
instrumental cause who take the criminal into the jail. Ca..., catch the
criminal and pu..., put him in jail. And then, the sentence in jail is sactioned
by the judge. So, in the act of jailing the criminal, all three are involved.
The police. The judge. And the criminal. So, like that, when the soul suffers.
Material nature is the instrumental cause.  So, if a, I, if I, if somebody gets
a cough. Somebody gets a stomach upset. So, it is the body that is suffering.
So, the material nature is the instrumental cause. Supersoul is the sanctioning
cause. Supersoul is the sanctioning cause. Supersoul sanctions.

        upadraṣṭānumantā ca

And the soul is the initiating cause. So, actually, it is we who have done
certain karma for which we are meant to get certain reactions. So, we get the
reactions according to time, place, circumstance. And according to what is best
for our ev..., eventual reformation. So, in this way, we understand who is the
karta. The karta is actually all three. Let us understand this with one more
example, now. It is a diagram with a depiction of this over here. So, here, what
you see in the shade of v..., blue. That whole box, rectangular box. That is the
conditioned soul. Now, the conditioned soul, when the conditioned soul is in the
body. At that time, the soul is there. The Supersoul is there. And then,
material nature is there. Now, how do things work? See, there is s..., there is
sense object which is perceived. And the soul has perceived the sense object,
so, the in..., input of the sense object comes in and then the input comes in on
the sense object, so, the input comes in from here, like this. Then, after that,
the soul desires. And now, the soul of course desires the sense object. This,
that means desire goes outward. But the chain of execution, how it works? When
the desires, the soul desire..., the soul intends, that is Su..., that is
perceived by the Supersoul is present in the heart. And then, the Supersoul
sanctions. Now, when the Supersoul sanctions, at that time, material nature then
executes its. And then, the person engages in sense gratification. You know, but
this is how, a, we engage in activities. So, now, if we look at this carefully,
who are all the doers? The soul is the doer in the sense of being the desirer.
In the sense of being the initiator. Supersoul is sanctioner. And material
nature is the executor. So, all three are the doers. Now, what is the point of
the Gita verse over here?

        naiva kiñcit karomīti

So, what it means is:

        indriyāṇīndriyārtheṣu
        vartanta iti dhārayan

        vartanta iti dhārayan

That simply the senses are coming in contact with the sense objects. So, what
does it mean is, is that, a, there is no, there are some inevitable needs of the
body which have to be fulfilled. And those are fulfilled. But beyond that, there
is no further requirement to try to, a, engage in sense gratification. Because
the soul is not motivated by material desire. When the soul is not motivated by
material desire, then there is no further, you know, stimulation to do sensual
activities. And that is why the person stays protected. So, person does not get
bound. So, in this case, what will happen for a detached soul? What will happen
for a detached soul? So, actually, that means there is no, there is no desire
for sense gratification. There is "indriyāṇīndriyārtheṣu". So, material nature
means the senses. So, then, the, you know, body needs some food. So, then,
material nature basically, the sou..., the, so, the soul is inside the body. The
soul is here. And the body is a vehicle. And the body needs some fuel for the
vehicle. So, then, the food comes inside the body. And when the food is going
inside the body, the person does not think, oh, I am going to enjoy this food.

        indriyāṇīndriyārtheṣu
        vartanta iti dhārayan

You know, the senses are coming in se..., contact with sense objects. Now, we
may wonder, if a person does not desire, how can one eat food? You know, one
will have to have certain desire to eat food. Yes. The desire to eat food can be
there. But the desire while eating food can be, do, eat to live, or eat to
enjoy. So, now, when we eat to live, then there, there is no enjoying mentality
over there. When there is eat to enjoy, then the enjoying mentality comes. Takes
hold. And then, that can, you know, implicate one in karmic bondage. So:

        indriyāṇīndriyārtheṣu
        vartanta iti dhārayan

When one is engaged, one is engaged in contact with the senses and sense objects.
Then, there is no bondage involved over there. 

        indriyāṇīndriyārtheṣu
        vartanta iti dhārayan

So, now, let us understand this more. This is a very important concept to
understand in the Bhagavad Gita. And Prabhupada explains how, you know, this is,
a devotee acts for the sense gratification of Krishna. Hmm. For the pleasure of
Krishna. Uses all senses in Krishna's service. Now, that Krishna will introduce,
that we will point through in the verse:

        brahmaṇy ādhāya karmāṇi
        saṅgaṁ tyaktvā karoti yaḥ
        lipyate na sa pāpena
        padma-patram ivāmbhasā

So, when the soul offers the karma. To whom? "brahmaṇy ādhāya karmāṇi". "ādhāya"
means to offer, to resign, to hand over. So, when one does one's karma, what
does one think? Oh, this is for the Absolute Truth. This is, so, d...,
Prabhupada explains it from the devotional perspective. "saṅgaṁ tyaktvā karoti
yaḥ". So, when one gives up attachment and acts. Such a person, "lipyate na sa
pāpena". Such a person does not become bound by karma. Why? Because that person
is like "padma-patram ivāmbhasā". So, "ambhasā". "ambhasā" is water.
"padma-patram" is lotus. So, "brahmaṇy ādhāya karmāṇi". So, when we offer the
work to the Absolute Truth. Now, the word brahman, the achar..., Baladeva
Vidyabhushana. So, different acharyas explain the brahman in different ways. So,
it will depend on what is the conception. For a bhakta, bhakta will understand
brahman is actually Bhagavan. And Prabhupada is explaining from that
perspective. That the bra..., for the brahman, the, for the bhakta, brahman be
a, Bhagavan. The devotee offers all the work to Krishna, and thus for uses all
the sensory activities for Krishna's pleasure. The karma-yogi may not know at
this stage that, actually, the Absolute Truth is Bhagavan. So, what does the
karma-yogi do? The karma-yogi will work understanding that it is material nature
that is acting. So, the word brahman can also be used to refer to material
nature. This will happen in the Fourteenth Chapter. You know, thi..., third and
fourth verses, Krishna talks about where brahman refers to material nature. He
says that, m..., "sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya", "mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ". "sa...":

        sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya
        mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ

A..., m..., so, there, He says, a...:

        brahma mahad yonir
        ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā

So, there, He says that "brahma mahad yonir". So, the great womb, that womb is
referring to, He uses the word brahman to explain that. But that womb refers to
m...:

        sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya
        mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ

"sarv...", so, basically, Krishna is telling "sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya". All living
beings, what happens? They get their forms within the womb of material nature.
"mūrtayaḥ". So, the "mūrtayaḥ" refers here to the forms. So, they get the form
through material nature. And the great womb, "ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā". Krishna
says, I give the seed. And who is it that gives the seed? It is actually Krishna
that gives the seed. And who is it that uses the seed? The person who uses the
seed is that m..., tha...,  that is material nature. So, material nature is
ref..., used, referred to by the word brahman over here. So, "ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ
pitā". "brahma mahad yonir". So, the word brahman can refer to material nature,
also. And here, w..., if the person does not know about the Absolute Truth. That
person may think, ok, it is material nature acting. So, I am not acting in this
way. So, when one thinks in this way. So, when one does not, you know, get
oneself emotionally involved in the actions of material nature. When one does
not think that I am the doer. I am the enjoyer. Then, that person does not
become bound. And the example for that is, given is "padma-patram ivāmbhasā".
"padma-patram". "padma" is lotus. So, now, lotus has this characteristic that
even if water falls on, it, lotu..., water just slips away. The lotus flower
does not stay wet for very long. In fact, if there is some dirt on it, also,
wa..., the wat..., dirt also gets slipped o..., o..., o..., washed off. And the
water also gets washed off. So, it does not stay wet. So, "padma-patram
ivāmbhasā" means, wa..., the karma does not bind to the soul. The karma just
washes off. Because there is no emotional attachment which will bind the soul.
So, now, actually, this property of lotus is so remarkable that has, it has
been exp..., it has been utilised even by the, you know, commercial industry.
You know, there are reseachers who observed how is that lotus, it does not,
wa..., water does not stick to it. And by observing the m..., m..., way a lotus
leaf is constructed. Then, its surface density i..., its surface tension, and
its surface construction, and all those things, wa..., by ob..., observing them,
researchers have replicated that. And then, when they have to, they make
skyspirit..., big skyscraper buildings. Now, these skyscraper buildings are
meant to be, loo..., look very good, also. But they have to be clean. Now, how
will you clean the? How will somebody clean them? You cannot have people
climbing on boa..., on ladders every day to clean these skyscraper buildings.
So, they des..., a, they have designed with lotus and facades. What is? They
called as lotus and facades. Facade means front face. Lotusen means they are
like lotus. So, if just water is sprinkled from above. Then, that water, they
are made, the facade, the, their walls are made in such a way that nothing
sticks too much to them. So, when water goes off, water also slips off. And
along with that, water cleanses the way, whatever dust particles are there,
only. And in this way, they stay clean. So, "padma-patram ivāmbhasā". So, a
devotee who is working in the material world can similarly stay detached, can
say "padma-patram ivāmbhasā", if that devotee works in this way. In what way?
"brahmaṇy ādhāya karmāṇi". So, Prabhupada quotes how Krishna is curiatriating
what He has said in 3.30.

        mayi sarvāṇi karmāṇi sannyasya

So, Prabhupada translates brahman, "brahmaṇy", Supreme Personality of Godhead.
And for that, he correlates this with 3.30. 27:45
