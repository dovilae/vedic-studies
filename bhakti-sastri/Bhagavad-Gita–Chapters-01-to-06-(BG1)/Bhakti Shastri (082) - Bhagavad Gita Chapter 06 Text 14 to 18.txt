Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are
in the Sixth Chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. We discussed in the last class, up
towards this 14. You know, into the middle of ashtanga-yoga. So, I will look at
some of the concepts of ashtanga-yoga, which our, indirectly pointed to. For
example, "brahmacarya" is there. "aparigrahaḥ" is there. So, we will look at
these concepts. So, in ashtanga-yoga, there are eight stages. Yama. Niyama.
Asana. Pranayama. So, in Yama and Niyama, there are further elements. There are
five elements, each of them. So, we will look at those five elements. And we
will also look at, you know, what they involve. And what fruits they provide.
So, let us look at this. So, hmm, what are the frui..., so, ahimsa, satyayam...,
satyam, asteya, "brahmacaryaṁ", "aparigrahaḥ". These are the five elements of
Yama. Now, these elements were referred to by Krishna, r..., you know, in this
section. He had talked about "aparigrahaḥ." in 6.10. Then, He talked about
"brahmacaryaṁ" in 6.14. And like that, He has been talking about these. So, when
He is talking about these, you know, you know, a, so, in general, He is talking
about specific elements. So, the Bhagavad Gita is not a systematic analysis of
the path of yoga. Here, Krishna is assuming that the yogi, that the
transcendentalist always know, already knows about yoga. There are specific
books for ashtanga-yoga. Like Patanjali Yoga Sutra. And there are other books,
also, which talk about yoga. Patanjali is, Yoga Sutra is the most famous. And,
you know, so, these books give a general knowledge about yoga. You know. And
the Bhagavad Gita does not go into the technicalities. Bhagavad Gita gives
general outline of yoga. Not a technical detailed analysis of yoga. So, in
general, the B..., goal of the Bhagavad Gita is not to exhaustively delineate
any one path. Its goal is to help understand, understand, Ar..., Arjuna
understand which is the best path. So, with respect to bhakti, also, you know,
the Bhagavad Gita does not go into an exhaustive delineation of bhakti. You
know. The way we see 64 elements of bhakti being talked about in Nectar of
Devotion. We do not see anything like that in the Bhagavad Gita. Why? Because
the Bhagavad Gita is in many ways an emergency book. It is spoken on the
battlefield. It is not spoken in a gurukula, where a guru can at leisure
instruct the disciple in the technicalities, ev..., everything. And the, it is
also spoken according to the level of the audience. So, Arjuna, he knows about
the various paths. He knows about bhakti. He knows about jnana. He knows about
ashtanga-yoga. So, Arjuna's question is not what he should do. Arjuna's question
is not what is a particular path. His question is what should I do? That means,
which path should I follow? So, it is like, in one sense, we may have career
counselling. You know, student has just finished a ten standard. And deciding.
Should I take art? Should I take commerce? Should I take science? So, at that
time, when the career counselling is offered, you know, what all is taught in
arts, since not ex..., or in commerce, or in science, is not exhaustively
described. You know, there will be separate course for that. And the student can
choose that. You know. If the student is interested. What will be off..., told
at career counselling is, the pluses, minuses of the various, ca..., ca...,
career options. So that the student can make an intelligent and well-informed
choice. Like that, there are various yoga, a, yoga ye..., ladder, wake-up paths.
And the Bhagavad Gita, it basically tells Arjuna, it is like a ca..., it is like
a, n..., not a career counselling. It is like, we could say, a, a yoga
counselling center. You know, which yoga had to follow. Life counselling.
Which yoga one should follow in one's life. And for that purpose, Krishna
analyses various yoga paths in principle. What are their pluses? What are their
minuses? And then, He tells, what is the path? Is, this is the best for
Arjun..., Arjuna.

So, the, we will see, as the flow of the Bhagavad Gita moves forward, Krishna
will, you know, focus on the paths involving action more. Then, the path
involving renunciation. And among the paths involving action, karma-yoga and
bhakti-yoga. Krishna will recommend bhakti-yoga. So, that is, as we move forward
in the flow of the Bhagavad Gita. But suffice it to say, right now, Krishna here
focuses, you know, not the detailed analysis of any path. He focuses on the, you
know, general principles of the pluses and minuses of those paths. So, that is
why we do not see these five elements talked about. It is just, the reference is 
there. So, ahimsa. Now, ahimsa means non-violence. The, ahimsa will be mentioned
later on in the Bhagavad Gita, also, in several places. And Srila Prabhupada
will also explain about ahimsa, you know, in his purports on several occasions.
A yogi especially, when, you know, in the material, when we are in the material
world, to some extent, ahimsa, ahimsa is inevitable. Even when we eat food, some
grains are ca..., you know, some germs, and some microscopic organisms, and some
small organisms, they die. But beyond that, ksatriya has to kill. But if a
person is taking, you know, practicing yoga, renunciation, then the path of
yoga. At that time, that person should follow ahimsa. In general, the Vedic
culture encourages that person to cause minimum violence to others. But even
then, some violence may sometimes be required. So, ahimsa means, no violence to
others. That is one of the yamas of, you know, the path of yoga. Now, Patanjali
describes each of these yamas. And also describes, what is the result of
following those yamas. So, what does he say? When we practice y..., ahimsa, then
what is the result of that? By the practice of ahimsa, others give up their
enmity to you. So, then, we, you know, when people feel us as threats. When
people feel that we will commit violence to them, then they become, tend to
become violent towards us. If they see that, ok, we are not going to be violent,
then, in many ways, their violence to us decreases. It can go away, also. So,
the practice of ahimsa will lead to others giving up their enmity. In satyam.
That is ahimsa, satyam, "aparigrahaḥ". Satyam means speaking truthfully. So,
satyam is, actually, recognised as a virtue. You know, i..., in all religions.
And it is an important moral principle, also. People who habitaully speak lies
to get their way, you know, eventually find that their ways b..., obstructed
by the lack of trust which others have. You know. If people who speak lies, they
eventually w..., you know, others find out those person not trustworthy. You
know, we can fool some people some of the time. Fool some people all the time.
Or this is all people some of the time. We cannot fool all the people all the
time. So, bec..., you know, people eventually find out. Even if they do not
exactly catch us, they will realise that, this person is, you know, place around
with the truth. Playing games with the truth. And they do n..., cannot trust us.
So, satyam is an important virtue. You know, even mater..., even in, as for
mundane morality. So, in yogic morality, also, it is important. So, satyam. And
interestingly, what, Patanjali says that, when we speak truth, what is the
result of that? When we speak the truth, what we speak will become, will be
endowed with the power, and will come true. So, what we say will be endowed with
power. And will come true. That is satya-vratah. So, satya-vratah means
satyavat, satya-sankalpa, satya-vratah. Like that. There are many verse which,
you know, are used to glorify those who are connected with the truths.

Satyavat means those who, you know, satya-sankalpa refers to one whose desires
come true. So, one of, that is one of attributes of the Lord. Whatever He
desires, happens. satya-sankalpa. Satyavat means that person who speaks the
truth. satya-vratah. One who takes a vratah. And keep the vratah true. So, like
that, there are many verse, so, the person who speaks the truth, or, or the
person, whatever that person speaks, that becomes true. So, that is the power
that comes in the powe..., the speech of a person. If the person speaks
cautiously, seriously, then that person ena..., you know, helps others to also,
you know, rec..., that, that sort of s..., you know, garb, careful speech helps
others, also, to respect that person. And it is not that we want respect for
ourselves. But we are representing Krishna, who is the ultimate truth. So, we
need to speak truthfully. Then, asteya. Asteya means, steya is to steal. So, we
can remember it from steya. English word is stea..., steal, also, a ste..., same
sound is there. So, asteya means non-stealing. So, when does not, one does not
try, just, a, steal the wealth from others, then what happens? That person
acquires true wealth. That is the fruit that the Yoga Sutra said. True wealth
is, ultimately spiritual wealth. But wealth comes to us, brahmacarya. So,
brahmacarya means, we discussed, at one level, not indulging in sex. And another
level, it is living spiritually. So, when one, you know, practices brahmacarya,
one acquires power. So, the, so, basically, the human being has power. As
spiritual being, also, we have power. Now, when a person engages in sex. That
energy gets dissipated. Apart from all the social complications, emotional
entanglements, physical debilitation, medical sicknesses, that can happen
because of indiscriminate sexuality. You know, you know, sex..., but beyond
that, actually, there is a subtle power. So, that power, you know, which we
have, if it is, it is dis..., if it is dissipated in sex, then we lose it. So,
but if it is conserved, then it becomes manifest in other ways. And it manifests
as creativity, as concentration, as clarity. As, you know, you know, basically,
the person becomes intellectually radiant, and spiritually potent by the power
of brahmacarya. That dharana shakti and vira..., vicara shakti, vani shakti. All
these things. You know, Prabhupada even said that, you know, one of the reasons
why Gandhi was so successful in his, you know, in leading India towards
independence, although he had no weapons was that, he, although being a
householder, he practiced brahmacarya. And that gave him power. So,
"aparigrahaḥ". "aparigrahaḥ" is a fifteen. "aparigrahaḥ" means one does not, you
know, you know, possess things unnecess..., one does not have a possessive
mentality. So, when one does not have that possessive mentality, then, you know,
one is able to see things truly. Otherwise, one is just caught in, you know, can
I get this? Can I get this? Can I get this? So, then, whatever we are getting,
we start seeing things deeply. We see, ok, this, this is how, this thing came to
me by my karma. And this thing, now, I have lost because of my karma. So, we see
the actions of karma. We not, we do not see the things just as events. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, when Haridasa Thakur departed, he says, Lord Krishna being
merciful to me, gave me the association of Haridasa Thakur. And Lord Krishna
being independent now broke that associaton.

So, we just do not see things as events. We see things in their broader
connection. So, like that, we get insight into the causes of events. And the
karmic causes of events. We start understanding things from a deeper
perspective. So, when we are not caught up in just trying to possess things.
Then, we can see things from a deeper perspectives. This is the fruit of yama.
Then, now, let us look at the fruits of niyama. So, yama and niyama are the
first two aspects of bhakti, of ashtanga-yoga. So, niyama has five aspects.
Sh..., Shauca. Santo..., Santosha. Tapa. Svadhyaya. Ishvara-Pranidhana. Shauca
is cleanliness. So, cleanliness, Prabhupada explains, means that, you know, we
take a bath. We keep ourselves clean. And Prabhupada would often quote, you
know, quo..., correlate. Or link physical cleanliness and internal cleanliness.
You know, say, by chanting Hare Krishna, we cultivate inner, internal
cleanliness. Here, of course, the focus is in niyama. The focus, if you see, is
on Shauca. Cleanliness. Suci is a very important quality. So, b..., what is the
reason for talking about so much cleanliness? You know. As devotees, we want
cleanliness. Because when we take the trouble to clean the body, we become
aware, that forces us to become aware of how clea..., unclean the body
inherently is. You know, when we are just, you know, people, inevitable, body
is sweats they just put some, you know, some, you know, perfumes. And something
like that. They just try to, you know, deny and conceal the unclean nature of
the body by using artificial ways. Then, they stay on, on the illusion that the
body is very pleasant. And the body is very enjoyable. But when we are, when we
follow strictly ru..., rules and regulations, like devotees bath several times
a day at times. So, that way, what happens by that is, we are forced to become
aware. This body is so unclean. And then, you know, by that, by the
conscientious effort, it, cleanliness. One, when one understands this body is
actually unclean. So, then, one becomes detached from the body. So, cl..., so,
cl..., the, the, you know, discipline of cleanliness brings detachment. Then,
similarly, Santosha. Santosha means satisfaction. So, now, you know, what does
satisfaction mean? See, i..., in general, whenever and wherever we live, you
know, there will always be people who have more things than us. And people who
have less things than us. So, we kee..., we have a choice. We can look at people
who have m..., more things than us. You know. Ok. I have got two-villar. That
person has got a four-villar. I have a got a two VHK house. That person has got
a three VHK house. You know. I have got a simple cellphone. That person has got
a smartphone. So, we can compare. And then, this comparison is like the cancer
of the mind. This comparison keeps us perpetually miserable. Now, in certain
situations, for functional requirements, we may need more things. And if we need
more things, we engage, the, acquire them. But beyond that, by making m...,
things, itself, you know, the focus of our thoughts, we erode our mental energy
by that. And we find ourselves unnecessarily irritated. Unnecessarily envious.
Unnecessarily, you know, dissatisfied. So, how do we get satisfaction? You know,
satisfaction comes by not thinking about the things that will cause
dissatisfaction. We think of other things. So, satisfaction is a, we may say,
general thing, I am feeling satisfied. I am not feeling satisfied. So, we often
think of satisfaction as a condition. However, satisfaction is not just a
condition. You know. Satisfaction is also a choice. Satisfaction is also a
decision. It is not just a condition or an emotion.

I feel satisfied. That means what? Oh. The emotion of satisfaction is there
within me. So, but it is not just an emotion or condition. It is a choice and a
decision. So, choice and a decision means, ok, this is what I will be satisfied
with. I am not going to think about more things. Because the quest for material
improvement is actually endless. You know, we can just keep improving our things
materially. And thinking, oh, this is got, I got this. I got, you know, you
know, this kind of computer. Now, let me get that kind of computer. I got this
kind of, you know, iPod. Now, let me get a more expensive iPod. And so many
things, like that, you can keep, that, the quest for material improvement is
endless. So, unless we ourselves put a stop on it, we will not, you know, ever,
you know, we able to redirect our energy from material things towards Krishna.
You know. Certainly, we have to live in the material world. And we may want to
have a particular standard of living. That is fine. Aas per our socioeconomic,
sociocultural circles, we can choose a particular standard that we want to live
on. But once we decide that. That has to be realistically decided. It is not
that if I want such a s..., if I earn a particular amount, I, and I think I will
have a house, I have a house, which puts me in a loan for 35 years. Getting that
house. Then, I have, I am just taking a loan which is beyond my capacity. And
then, I am subjecting myself to unnecessary anxiety. So, satisfaction does not
necessarily mean that one cannot have ambition. Satisfaction simply means that
one has to have, you know, one has to be clear about one's priorities. Many
times, people think satisfaction means, oh, I will become, there will be nothing
exciting after in my life. But actually, a devotee can have spiritual ambition.
A devotee can have ambition to make spiritual advancement. To learn the
scriptures. To share scriptural message. To get more and more people to come
closer and closer to Krishna. So, that ambition can be very purifying. Very
vitalising. You know. There is nothing as satisfying for a soul as, you know,
being able to be of tangible service to Krishna. There is nothing satisf..., as
satisfying for our heart, as seeing that our life is making a difference in
others' lives. Or, not just difference in terms of our immediate circle. But in
terms of others. Even we sh..., share Krishna Consciousness with others. And we
see that they are actually becoming happier. Their life is becoming transpond,
positively. When the sublime satisfaction that comes by that is f..., is among
the most enriching experiences of life. So, we all need something to look
forward to, something to be excited about. Ma..., so, ma..., materialistic
society makes us excited about materialistic things. But actually, the pursuit
of materialis..., things is, you know, is agitating. And the achievement of this
material things is anticlimax. It never lives up to the hype. So, rather than
that, pur..., rather than pursuing that which will end in a disappointment. We
turn and focus on Krishna. And focus on serving Krishna more and more. Santosha
is a choice. Ok. This is what I will be satisfied with. I am not going to go
further in this direction. Then, tapa. Tapa means austerity. Shauca. Santosha.
Tapa. You know. Tapa can be of various types. It, generally, Krishna talks a...,
Prabhupada would talk about austerity, you know, the fasting. So, tapa,
whatever austerities we do, you know, the austerity removes the impurities. And
it helps us to become, you know, strong at the level of the body and the senses.
Strong, not in terms of enjoying sense gratification. But strong in terms of
stamina and stability for that use.

Svadhyaya. Shauca. Santosha. Tapa. Svadhyaya. Ishvara-Pranidhana. Svadhyaya is
studying of scripture. Now, it is interesting. What is the result of studying
scripture? That leads to connection with God. When we study scripture, by the
study of scripture, we become connected with God. So, how does that happen? You
know. By the conn..., by the study of scripture, we understand that there is a
higher reality. And that higher reality is ultimately centered on Krishna. And
the scriptures, so, Svadhyaya is not just any ordinary study. If somebody says
that, every day morning, I do Svadhyaya of the newspaper for one hour. That is
not Svadhyaya. That is simply entertainment. You know, so, you know, we do not
learn much by studying these paper. You know, even, we may have to read the
newspaper to stay in touch with current event. But we do not have to spend
hours on that. Just a current, quick look at the headlines. You know. That is
often enough. More than enough what we need to know. You know. But Svadhyaya
refers to study of scriptures. Study of books that help us to, you know, move
towards hi..., life's higher realities. So, Svadhyaya, i..., that leads to,
m..., you know, connection with God. We start, when we study scripture properly,
then we develop shastra "cakṣur". And these eyes of scripture. And that, by, we
c..., by that, we can see the hand of Krishna. We can see the world as Krishna's
energy. And that is a very spiritually enriching mission. And then, last is
Ishvara-Pranidhana. Ishvara-Pranidhana. Pranidhana means surrender. So, by
surrender to Ishvara, what is the result? One gains samadhi. Samadhi. Samadhi is
the ultimate goal of yoga. That is the eighth stage. And he says that, by
Ishvara-Pranidhana, one will eventually come to the stage of samadhi. So, that
way, the primary purpose of the practice of spiritual life is, a, to attain
Ishvara-Pranidhana. To att..., to attan surren..., you know, attain the love for
the Lord. That is the stage of samadhi. And beyond. And Ishvara-Pranidhana
takes us to that. So, now, we will see clearly that yoga involves devotion. The
ashtanga-yoga process, here, the yogi may not be having a deity and worshipping
the deity. Yogi may not be having, you know, direct devotional activities that
we see. But the idea of a Supreme Being to whom we have to, on whom we have to
meditate. It is a central part of yoga. It is an important limb in niyama.
Ishvara-Pranidhana. So, now, some people say that their, the whole process of
yoga is, you know, is non-devotional. So, we have to understand that yoga, it is
not just one monolithic body. It is not that when people think of yoga,
everybody thinks about the same one set of things. See, the proce..., just as
there have been many, you know, m..., many bhakti thinkers, many mayavadi
thinkers, there is, there are many thinkers on yoga, also. And different people
have come up with different conceptions of yoga. So, in the Vedanta Sutra,
Vyasadeva, and in our Sampradaya, Baladeva Vidyabhushana, when they write the
commentary on the Vedanta Sutra, actually, they refute yoga. When yoga is used as
an independent body of knowledge. And then, yoga a..., tends to take a person
towards a non-personalistic conclusion. Towards a monistic conclusion. You know.
Where one thinks that one will merge in an Absolute Reality. M..., m..., so,
that kind of yoga is refuted. But that is not the only kind of yoga that there
is.

There are many books that talk about yoga. There are many scholars who have, not
just contemporary scholars, but throughout history, who have written about yoga.
Patanjali was one of them. Patanjali, there are many indications from his, you
know, his, you know, stru..., statements in Yoga Sutra as well as in other
places. That actually, he, he was a vaishnava. He was a devotee. And he has not
spoken specifically and directly about Lord Vishnu or Lord Krishna. Because the
process of, the book of ashtanga-yoga, the book of Patanjali Yog..., Yoga, Yoga
Sutra is primarily manual for yoga. And in this book, he just gives a knowledge,
about, he says, ok, one should, you know, surrender to Ishvara. So, he assumes
that his readers know who is Ishvara. He is not focusing there on giving
exhaustive knowledge of Ishvara. He is ha..., he is, when he writes a book, he
has a particular fo..., purpose. So, the purpose is that he wants to outline the
process of yoga. And in that, he, he takes the, he takes it, does, the audience
knows what is yo..., Ishvara. And how one should do Ishvara-Pranidhana. So, he
does not go into the technical detali..., details of all that. So,
Ishvara-Pranidhana is an important element. And it indicates the bhakti element.
So, now, some yogis may think that this bhakti element is transitional. That
means we meditate on this Absolute Truth now. And after meditating on the
Absolute Truth, eventually, we will learn that I am the Absolute Truth. But
there are other yogis who understand that Absolute Truth is the, is the, not
just the object of meditation transitionally. Transitionally means, for the time
of sadhana. But the Supreme Lord is the object of meditation eternally. And
those yogis are, you know, many are personalists. So, they can even attain, you
know, li..., m..., liberation and shantaras sign in the spiritual world. Like the
trees meditate on the Supreme Lord as He performed various pastimes. So, they
can attain shantaras perfection. Or if they get association of devotees. And
they get involved, inspired to practice active devotional service. Then, they
can get further elevated, also. So, now, in the Bhagavad Gita, we looked in five
poi..., in sev..., 6.14, the last part was C and D.

        manaḥ saṁyamya mac-citto
        yukta āsīta mat-paraḥ

So, that refers to this limb of Ishvara-Pranidhana. Now, that refers to, how, by
surrender to Ishvara. Meditating on Ishvara, one moves forward towards
perfection. Now, you know, these, when we look at these eight limbs, yama,
niyama, asana, pranayama. So, actually speaking, these are things which are
required in any, every path. For example, if we have a, you know, it is again
very sim..., very contemporary example, maybe not entirely precise. But
illustrates the point of how th..., in one, some ways, these eight principles are
universal. You know. There are, suppose, there is a football match. Hmm. Or
there is a cricket match, say. Then, there is a batsman. So, there is yama and
niyama. Yama and Niyama. There are dos and donts. There are certain things the
batsman can do. The batsman should wear a helmet. Batsman should carry a bat.
And when the bowler comes and bowls. And the batsman hits. And the fielder is
closed by one of the..., look at, keep, at dovetail the catch. The batsman
cannot go and tuck. Swing the bat at the, you know, f..., k..., fielder's head.
You know, the bat is made to only hill..., hit the ball, not the fielder's head.
So, there are certain things which are supposed to be done. So, this is not
supposed to be done. So, there are rules. Dos and donts. There are c..., rules
for individual conduct. And there are individuals, who do also g..., group
conduct. So, if we see here, niyama, generally, people, the, two ways of looking
of yama and niyama. Yama is donts. Niyama is dos. So, niyama is these are all
positive. Shauca. Santosha. Tapa. Svadhyaya. Ishvara-Pranidhana. What all we
should do. Niyama. Another way of looking at niyama is that niyama is the rules
for individual discipline. You know, cleanliness is something which I have to do
individually. Contentment is generally to have individually. This is what I do
myself. Whereas the ni..., a..., yama is generally seen in terms of what all I
should not do. You know. Oppo..., so, that is why, in, in three of these, we
have "a". A..., do not do ahimsa. Do not steal. Do not, you know, have
possessive mentality. And then, satyam and "aparigrahaḥ", they also have the
negative idea that do not speak lies. That do not indulge in sexu...,
indiscriminate in sexu..., sexuality. So, now, another way of looking at this
is, yama is, yama, rules of group discipline. That means how one should interact
with others. 27:01
