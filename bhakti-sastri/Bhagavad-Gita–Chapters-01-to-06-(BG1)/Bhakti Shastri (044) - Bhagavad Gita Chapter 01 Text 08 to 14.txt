Hare Krishna.

	sarathyam arjunasyadau, kurvan gitamrtam dadau 
	loka-trayopakaraya, tasmai krsnatmane namah

Hare Krishna.

So, today, we continue with our discussion on the Bhagavad Gita. We start with
1.8. We discussed till now about primarily the influence of Kurukṣetra, a pious
place. We discussed about the dynasty, before, before the Pandavas, going up to
Shantanu. And then we also discussed about the way in which Sanjaya got the
mystical vision to see the battlefield at Kurukṣetra. And to report that to
Yudhisthira..., to Dhṛtarāṣṭra. So, now, let us look from verse eight onwards.
Till now, Dhṛtarāṣ..., Du..., Duryodhana has been describing the power of those
on his opposite side. Now, he is starting describing powe..., the power of those
on his side. So:

        bhavān bhīṣmaś ca karṇaś ca
        kṛpaś ca samitiṁ-jayaḥ
        aśvatthāmā vikarṇaś ca
        saumadattis tathaiva ca

So, "bhavān bhīṣmaś ca karṇaś ca". So, "bhavān" is a respectful second person
address. So, "tvam" is a normal second person address, like "I" and "you". "I"
is first person. "You" is second person. So, "tvam" and "bhavān" are second
person addresses. And "bhavān", "tvam" is used in the more ordinary sense.
"bhavān" is used in the more respectful sense. So, now, because Duryodhana is a
ksatriya. And Droṇācārya is a brahmana. So, therefore, Duryodhana is referring
to Droṇācārya with respect address, "bhavān". Now, also, here, the acharyas have
described that Duryodhana is thinking. Bhishma is the commander. And on this
battlefield, he is also the seniormost. So, it was Bhishma in fact who, who
recruited Droṇācārya as the teacher for the Kauravas. So, both in terms of
seniority, in terms of hierarchy over here on the war field, and in terms of
course power. Bhishma is the greater than Droṇā. So, he is thinking now, already
come to Droṇācārya. And I am speaking. Now, when he is speaking, when the king
speaks, everybody else becomes silent. So, people are hearing what he is
speaking. So, even Bhishma is also close by. And Bhishma is also hearing. So,
he is thinking, now, I, when I am going to talk about the strength of the forces
on my side, whose name should I take first? So, normally, Bhishma is the
commander. His name should be taken first. But then, I am s..., right now,
standing in front of Droṇācārya. So, he is, normally, if we go to a person. And
right in front of that person, we glorify somebody else instead of appreciating
that person, it may be triggered as a snub of that person. So, he thinks. And
then, he, he is actually, whatever be the other hierarchies, Droṇācārya is a
brahmana. And brahmanas are to, always to be respected more than ksatriyas. Even
if  Droṇācārya is fighting as a ksatriya now. He is taking on the role of a
ksatriya here. He is born as a brahmana. And mostly, he has been living as a
brahmana. So, therefore, Bhishma will not mind if I address him first. Because
he will understand that he is a brahmana. And he is, I am a ksatriya. So,
Bhishma will not mind. On the other hand, if I mention Bhishma's name first. I
am standing in front of Droṇā, Droṇā may mind. So, therefore, I have already
slightly irritated Droṇā by mentioning Drupada's name also. So, I want to
agitate him enough so that he will fight wholeheartedly. But I do not want to
agitate him so much that he will become irritated with me and will be
disinclined to fight vigorously. Therefore, he starts with "bhavān". So, he is
standing right in front of Droṇācārya. And He says you. Now, in the previous
verse, he said, Lord, now I endless the:

        nāyakā mama sainyasya

The leaders of my force. You are a leader. Bhishma is a leader.

        bhavān bhīṣmaś ca karṇaś ca

Now, interestingly, Karṇa is not there anywhere on the battlefield at that time.
Karṇa is not there on the battlefield. But he is very prominently there in the
mind of Duryodhana. Because Duryodhana was confident of the full commitment of
Karṇa. He was not sure about the commitment of Bhishma and Droṇā. But he was
sure of the commitment of Karṇa. And that also, after Karṇa in a half had backed
out of the war saying that as long Bhishma is fighting, I will not fight.
Actually, before the war started, you know, Duryodhana had asked Bhishma to give
a comparative assessment of the two forces along with the f..., strength of the
specific individuals. So, at that time, while assessing various foldie...,
forced, Bhishma had ranked Karṇa very lowly. And Karṇa had become infuriated by
that. He said he always denigrate me. And he said I can, by my own single power,
my power alone, I can defeat the whole Kaurava..., whole Pandava army. And I
alone can attain victory. So, Bhishma has looked scornfully at him. And he said,
you know, when have your bones been translated into actions, Oh, Karṇa? He says, every
time that you have encou..., confronted, Kuntheya, you have been vested. So,
actually, many people think Karṇa was more powerful than Arjuna. And our Krishna
used deviousness. Deviousness means trickery to defeat Karṇa. But actually,
there had been several confrontations. And each of them, Karṇa had been vested.
Karṇa had been defeated by Arjuna. So, if we look back at the history, the first
encounter between the two of them was in the Marshall exhibition which
Droṇācārya had arranged on the outskirts of Hastinapur after the education of
both the Pandavas and Kauravas had been completed. So, there, Arjuna
excelled everyone else. And Duryodhana's heart burned in envy. So, just as
Arjuna was, you know, ex..., finishing the exhibition of his prowess, suddenly a
thunderous footsteps were heard outside. And a powerful f..., bodied person came
in. Then, that person asked, I, I can exhibit all that Arjuna has done. Am I
allowed it? So, Kripacharya, Droṇācārya looked at each other. They said yes. And
then, Karṇa equaled ev..., everything that Arjuna had done. And then,
Duryodhana's hearts welled in pride and joy. He said, now, he, he was, for him,
Karṇa became a tool to get back at Arjuna. He felt that I can get back at Bhima.
I can get a back, become, at Bhima. Eventually, there is going to be a war. And I
can get the better of Bhima bottom. Who will defeat Arjuna? Karṇa will do that.
And at that time, Karṇa said, now, I would like to have a st..., deal with
Arjuna. So, Arjuna stiffened. Arjuna wanted to put this arrogant warrior in his
place. And as they got ready, so Kripacharya said, ok, but deals can only be
among equals. You know, he is a son of a, he is a son of illustrious father in
the Kuru dynasty. Who is, whose son are you? Who are you? So, Karṇa's head fell
at that time. And then, when Duryodhana saw this, he spoke. Now, Duryodhana was
ve..., very eloquent. You know, when he wanted, he could quote scripture also
for his own purposes. He said, you know, oh, the scriptures say that actually it
is not birth alone which determines the varana of a person. It is qualities. Have
you not seen his marshall qualities? He is a ksatriya. And is it possible for a
cat to give birth to a lion? This person is a lion. Therefore, he must have
begotten by a lion. And even if you say, th..., that he is not a king. Then he
says, I will make him a king. And he said, I give him the Anga Prade..., Anga
Desh right now. I give, make him the ruler of Anga and bring the sacramental
water. And there itself, in the marshall exhibition, the water was brought. And
he sprinkled on Karṇa. And he was made the king. And Karṇa was overwhelmed by
this. So, now, Duryodhana did show kindness to Karṇa at that moment. But for
what purpose? He was not really benefactor of Karṇa. He just wanted to use Karṇa
for his own political purposes.

So, as Karṇa was anointed as the king, at that time, from the stands in the
assembly, an elderly person came running down to, towards Karṇa, to embrace him,
and see that Karṇa immediately bow..., bent down and bowed to him. And that was
Adhiratha. There, it was the sutha. It was one of the charioteers in the Kuru
kingdom. And he says, oh, father, he says, his fa..., Adiratha said, oh, I am so
happy to see that you have been anointed as a king. May you be blessed. You
are so fortunate. And saying that, now, oh, that he was a son of a sutha. Some
of the asse..., warriors over there said that, oh, he is a sutha, how can he
fight? How can he fight with Arjuna? So, Duryodhana said, he might have been
born as a sutha of a sutha. But he is now a king. He will fight. So, as they
were discussing, whether they should fight or not, the sun set. And they decided
that the co..., the, the co..., it would be a, end of the day. And after this
education when they were asked for, when both of them, Kauravas and Pandavas
went to Droṇācārya to say, what dakshine I can give you? So, he said, arrest
Drupada and m..., make him a prisoner. And bring to me. So, Duryodhana
immediately went with his full army. Both the Pandavas and Kauravas were there,
Arjuna said, no, let Duryodhana go first. We will go afterwards. So, then, at
that time, Droṇācārya, at Droṇācārya's behest, all the hundred Kaurava brothers
along with Karṇa went. And they were all defeated by Drupada and Dhṛṣṭadyumna
together. And they came back shamefaced. And then after that, the Pandavas went.
And the five Pandavas overcame Drupada and Dhṛṣṭadyumna. And then Drupada was
arrested and brought. So, at that time, Drupada felt humiliated to have been
defeated like this, and brought like a prisoner before Droṇācārya. But at the
same time, he admired the military prowess of the expertise of the Arjuna. And
he desired that, let me have a daughter who can become, whom, become his wife.
In this way, I will be related to this formidable warrior. And that is how
eventually when he did the yajna. So, at that time, Draupadī was born. He did
yajna actually primarily to take revenge against Drupada..., against Droṇā. So,
he got the sumon, and Draupadī borned. But anyway, the important point is here,
that time, that means Karṇa along with the Kauravas was defeated by Dr..., by
Drupada. And Drupada was defeated by Arjuna. So, in this way, Arjuna is superior
to Karṇa. Similarly, the second time that they took a, they had a direct,
indirect face of, or indirect comparison of strength, was at the svayaṃvara of
Draupadī. At that time, the Pandavas were in disguise as brahmanas. And all the
ksatriyas came and tried to show their prowess. Karṇa was not allowed because he
was not a ksatriya's, by birth. And then when Arjuna came as a, in the guise of
a brahmana, and he appears the fish eye and got Draupadī. All the ksatriyas were
in uproar. They said Drupada has arranged this assembly to humiliate all of us,
kings. And he has given his daughter to a k..., brahmana. They say, we should
punish Drupada right now. And they all took out their swords and cha..., start
charging toward Drupada. Drupada became alarmed. So, at that time, Yudhiṣṭhira
said to Arjuna and Bhima, he said that, now, he has become our father-in-law.
Protecting him is our duty. So, immediately, Bhima and Arjuna came in-between.
And then, at that time, Arjuna using the same arrow which he had used to shoot
the arrow in the svayaṃvara contest, he took the, took that same bow. And there
was face off. So, at that time also, there was a face off between Karṇa and
Arjuna. And they fought, and fought, and fought. And Arjuna expertly countered
all the weapons of Arjuna..., of Karṇa. And Karṇa said, who are you? So, he
said, just I, are you a God? Nobody else can counter my weapons like this. He
said, no. He says I am a faithful servant of my guru. He did not reveal that he
is Arjuna at that time. So, then, Karṇa put down his bow. He said that, he felt
that he is a brahmana and the military marshall power of ksatriyas is always
descended in the spiritual power of the brahmanas. So, even at that time, Karṇa
could not get the better of Arjuna. Then, later on again, when they were in
Kambivan, after the Pandavas had been exiled. So, there, Duryodhana came along
with Karṇa to try to flaunt his wealth in front of the Pandavas. And thereby
increase their pain. He, but then, at that time, the Gandharvas were there who
had been sent by Indra. And the Gandharvas told In..., Duryodhana, you are a
trust passing our, trea..., on a treaty. Get out of here. He said, this is my
kingdom. You get out of here. So, the confrontation. And the Gandharvas, at that
time, fought fiercely. And although Karṇa was by the side, Karṇa fled from
there. He was wounded. And he fled. And Duryodhana was arrested. And after that,
some of the soldiers from Dur..., Karṇa, from Duryodhana's camp, they ran over
to the other side of the lake, where Yudhiṣṭhira was performing sacrifices. So,
there was a lake on one side. Karṇa and Duryodhana had come. And they were, they
were flaunting their wealth. So that the Pandavas who were doing some yajna
could see. And their idea was they will burn in envy. But they were sat
completely turn. So, then, the soldiers came and told Karṇa. They told Duryo...,
Yudhiṣṭhira. Now, please, Duryodhana has been arrested. And all the ladies of
our family have been taken hostage. Please save them. So, at that time, at
Yudhiṣṭhira's behest, Arjuna got ready to go. The, Bhima said, you know, it
seems that last destiny has become favorable to us. What would have taken some
effort for us to do. Now, the Gods have done for us. So, at that, and
Yudhiṣṭhira said, no, no, no, you should not think like this. You know, we may
have our differences. But in front of the world, we are hundred and five. We may
be five and hundred. But in front of the world, we are hundred and five. And it
is the Kuru dynasty that has been insulted. If our ladies had been taken hostage
like this. So, you must go and save them. Bhima was not convinced. Then, at that
time, Yudhiṣṭhira knew how to a..., trigger Bhima. He said, you know, Bhima what
greater joy can you get than to show mercy on your greatest enemy, on one who
has hurt you the most? You know, what work can you get by that? Bhima said, yes,
now I go.

So, he, so, at, anyway, at that time again, Arjuna went. And Arjuna defeated all
the Gandharvas. And even the leader of the Gandharvas had to surrender, seeing
the fierce military power of Arjuna. So, again, here, the Gandharvas defeated
Karṇa. And Arjuna defeated the Gandharvas. So, again, Arjuna's power is greater
than Karṇa's. And after that also again, we see, that the biggest straight head
on confrontation was at Virata. At that time, at the end of the gnatavas, Arjuna
was acting as a maidse..., as a dance teacher, Brihannala. And he had come along
with the son of Virat to fight against the full Kaurava army. So, at that time,
all the Kaurava Mahartas were there. Duryodhana, Karṇa, Shakuni, Droṇācārya,
Bhishma, Duḥśāsana, Kṛpāchārya. All of them were, were there. And Arjuna single
handedly defeated all of them, single handedly. Not only were all of them, along
with them, their armies were there. But Arjuna single handedly defeated. And at
that time, Karṇa was also there. And Karṇa was also vested. So, the point is
that it is not at all true that Karṇa was stronger than Arjuna. No. Arjuna,
whenever there was a confrontation, Arjuna always got the better of Karṇa. But
eventually, when the battle took place, the final battle. So, in the Mahabharata
war, Bhishma was the commander for ten days, Droṇācārya for five days, Karṇa for
days, sheila for the last day. And Aśvatthāmā was like a self-appointed
commander for the last night in which he slaughtered. Not exactly
self-appointed. Duryodhana had only appointed him. But he was self-appointed in
the sense that, he, the strategy that he used was completely unethical. And he
came up with his own strategy. And killing a sleeping soldier was very very
castly. So, anyway, Karṇa was a commander for the, for last, for last, but, but
sixteen-seventeen days. Second last and third last days. So, at that time, on
sixteenth day, he, he exhibited his prowess. And he actually defeated all the
Kaura..., Pandavas, except Arjuna whom, with whom he did not meet on that day.
And the next day, there was a fierce head on battle. And they fought, and
fought, and fought, and fought, and when they turned for hours, and hours, and
hours.  And then at that time, by the will of destiny, Karṇa's chariot started
going into the ground. When Karṇa's chariot started going into the ground. So,
Karṇa told Arjuna. He says, do not entertain thoughts, which are cherished by
cowards. Wait till I am ready to fight, and then we will fight. So, at that
time, Karṇa..., Arjuna immediately put his bow down. So, when he put his bow
down. He waited. So, Krishna said, oh, Karṇa, it is surprising that today, you
remember the codes of morality and ask Arjuna to follow them. You know, where
were these codes of morality when you along with all the Kaurav..., when you
suggested that Draupadī be brought into the assembly and be disrobed. Where were
these codes of morality when you through Shakuni participated in the cheating
gambling match? Where were these codes of morality when you connived with the
Pan..., Kauravas to burn the Pan..., Ka..., Pandavas alive? Where was this code
of morality when you along with, fired the maharathas, killed the sixteen year
old Abhimanyu? Was it morality by which you did all these activities? And he had
listed of all the atrocities that the Kauravas had performed. And which Karṇa had
been a part. He says, if it is morality at all that time, Arjuna will use sa...,
the same morality and kill you today. Arjuna, shoot. And then Arjuna shot the
arrow. And Karṇa was killed. So, actually, what did Krishna want to demonstrate?
In a fair fight also, Arjuna could have defeated and killed Karṇa. But the point
that Arjuna wanted to make wa..., that Krishna wanted to demonstrate was that:

        Satho Sathyam

"Satho Sathyam" means that with the cunning, one has to be cunning. Whenever
it is required. One cannot let oneself in the name morality, in the name of
following a small morality, sacrifice a bigger morality. You know, in the
history of India, subsequently, this lesson was forgotten. And the forgetfulness
of this lesson pl..., led to very expensive c..., co..., very severe
consequences. For example, many times when the, when the muslims would attack
India. They would know attack the Hindu kings. They would know the Hindus
consider cows to be very holy. So, what they would do is, when they would be
attacking, they would have a whole herd of cows in front of them. And the hindu
warriors would think, oh, how can we shoot cows? And then, they would see that
there are cows, they will not shoot the cows. And behind the cows were the
muslim warriors. And then, they would shoot, and shoot, and shoot. And the
hindus would not shoot back. That was their idea. 20:30
