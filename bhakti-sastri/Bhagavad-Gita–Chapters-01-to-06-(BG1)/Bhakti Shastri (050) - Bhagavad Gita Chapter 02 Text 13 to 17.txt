Hare Krishna. So, welcome back to our Bhakti Sastri course on the Bhagavad Gita.
We are continuing with the second chapter. And we discussed til verse 2.12. And
"na tv evāhaṁ jātu nāsaṁ" was of discussed. We will start with 2.13. So, the
Bhagavad Gita's second chapter, which is called by Srila Prabhupada as "Contents
of the Gītā Summarized", is basically a call by Krishna to Arjuna to fight. So,
in the first section, Arjuna's fifth reason and e..., eventual refusal to
surrender is talked about from 2.1 to 10. And then, from 2.11 onwards, Krishna
starts speaking. So, 2.11 onwards to 2.30 is Sankhya. The soul is
indestructible, therefore fight. This is a counter to Arjuna's objection that if
I fight, then my relatives will be killed. I do not want them to die. So,
Krishna tells do not live in the ignorant bodily conception. Raise to the
enlightened spiritual conception. And know that, the performance of dharma never
causes harm to anyone. It brings ultimate good to everyone. And for bringing out
that ultimate good, if it involves some surgical cleansing, then that is what
needs to be done. So, that vision of what actually dharma is, based on
atma-jnana, is talked about in this section. So, we discussed 2.12 re...,
refutes impersonalism. It establishes the eternality of the individuality of the
soul. And now, 2.13. Let us start from there. So, we have:

        dehino ’smin yathā dehe
        kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā
        tathā dehāntara-prāptir
        dhīras tatra na muhyati

So, "dehino". Inside this "deha". "asmin". There is "yathā dehe". So, you know,
"dehino ’smin yathā dehe". Just as inside the body, there is the owner of the
body. So, and what is the nature of that owner? That, although the body changes,
the owner remains unchanging. "kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā". So, "kau...". So,
boyhood, youth and old age. These are the stages through which the body will go.
But the "dehi". A person who is situated inside the body will remain unchanging.
And similarly, "tathā dehāntara-prāptir". Similarly, when the person dies, at
that time, the person get another body. "dhīras tatra na muhyati". A wise
person, a so..., "na muhyati", is not bewildered. Now, Srila Prabhupada
translates "dhīras" as sober person. So, the word sober is often used in the
context of alcohol. You know, sober person is a person who is affected by, he is
not affected by alcohol. Who is this, not addicted to alcohol, or he had, or that
person has given up the addiction to alcohol. That is a sober person. So,
"dhīras tatra na muhyati". So, the bodily conception is like an intoxication.
And becoming free from that intoxication is an important goal of life. And that
goal of life is promoted by the practice of devotional service. So, that is what
is being talked about over here. That we should practice devotional service. And
by that, we will become freed from the bodily conception. Of course, when we
talk, saying here, it, the Bhagavad Gita does not give all of its messages at
once. It will build the message gradually. So, here, you know, devotional
service is not immediately mentioned. But it is mentioned indirectly that one
should become a "dhīra". When he says that, oh, oh, such, such things will not
trouble an intelligent person. The indirect meaning is if somebody is being
troubled by this, that means, that person needs to become intelligent. And then,
that trouble will not be there anymore. So, similarly, Krishna is giving
instruction here indirectly by demonstrating an example. Ok, this is how people
work. This is how people act. And if we act in this way, then we will not be
bewildered.

        dhīras tatra na muhyati

So, now, what is the point being made over here? We all, when we see a, a
relative or a friend after a long time, especially if a child we see, after a
long time. Hey, you have grown up so much. You were so small. I could pick you
up on a l..., on my palm. But now, you will not fit in my lap, also. Some
relatives may say after ten, if they meet a child after ten years or something
like that. So, what has happened? So, you were like that. And you are like this.
That is what we see. So, you were so small. And you have become so big now. So,
what has happened? That means there is unchanging dimension to that person that
is addressed by I or you. And there is a changing dimension. Which is addressed
by you were like this. And w..., you are like this. So, that means, all of us
have an unchanging dimension, unchanging aspect, unchanging feature to our
being. And we have a changing feature. So, what is this changing and unchanging?
Generally speaking, when we remember a dark complexion person may do some
plastic surgery or something like that, or may..., by that, may become fear...,
fair. Or a fat person may do bariatric surgery and become thin. A small-nosed
person may do a big-noise, may, surgery, and become big-nosed. Whatever.
Different people can do different things like this. But no matter, what they do,
still, they remain the same person. So, now, certainly, something has changed.
Something is the same. This is, now, somebody may say, no, no, I have changed
completely. I am not the same person. But then, even if somebody says, I am not
the same person. The "I", the reference to "I" is the same. So, there is,
some..., some..., somebody uses the same. So, for example, if I say that, ok, I
am living now. And I have not changed. So, the child was there. Now, I am a
young person, middle-aged person. So, I was a child earlier. So, whatever, it
is, is it this person the same or different? Somebody says, no, it is different.
Actually, child has gone gone. And I am the same. Most of us will not say like
that. Now, we can see that there is, definitely changed at a biological level.
Even science acknowledges that. There are different frames of reference that we
can take to look at the change of the bodily level. You know, if we look at the
level of organs. Although, my heart seems to be the same. My arm seem to be the
same. But the cells that make the heart and beyond, a, so, or the cells that
make the arm, they keep changing. So, if a thing is nothing more than its
components, then, the essential point is that if all the components have
changed, is the thing the same? Or is the thing different? So, we would say that
the thing has changed and thing is still the same. So, sometimes, you know, if,
if we have a laptop. And then, we change the motherboard. We change the hard
disk. We change the touchpad. We tange..., change the keyboard. Of course, most
people will not do such an overhauling. They will say better take a new laptop,
only. But when we change small, small, s..., parts like that. And then, we will
say, oh, this laptop is now as good as new. Because the hard disk is new. Or
because the RAM has been extended. Or whatever. So, at such times, what are we
exactly saying? Now, there, there is something that is n..., old and is
continuing. But there is something that is new. On the other hand, if I just
leave old laptop and take a new laptop. Then, entirely new laptop, that is
there. So, in the first case, there is, there is a gradual change. That means,
you know, say, if I have a laptop, first I change the, maybe, I change the
touchpad. Then, I change the motherboard. Then, I change the hard disk. Then, I
may change the monitor. So, there are progressive changes over there. But they
are one, one, one at a time. But if I just take a new laptop, that is a rapid
change.

So, Krishna is talking similarly about two kinds of reincarnation over here. The
word "incar", "carna" is related with flesh, like sexual, or especially lusty
pleasure, lusty illicit sex is called as carnal indulgences. So, ca..., or it
is also carnivorous. That is flesh eating. So, incarnation literally means to
come in flesh. Reincarnation means to come again in flesh. So, reincarnation
means that to again get a material body. So, reincarnation, generally, we used
that word in the sense of when a person dies, and then comes back now in another
body. That is what we refer to, generally, as reincarnation. But if we consider
that the fact that the body is constantly changing, constantly changing,
changing, changing. Then, we can also equally say that there is internal
reincarnation in the sense that the body is gradually changing. Just like the
parts of a computer may be changed. One at a time, one at a time. Similarly,
there can be internal reincarnation that can also happen. So, that is the
difference between in..., internal and external. What is the difference? One is
gradual, subtle, and often nearly invisible. Just happening slowly, slowly,
slowly. And the other is sudden, gras..., drastic and visible. Ok, that person
was here. That person has gone there. So, Krishna is saying that do not get so
worked up by the change. That, yes, whatever change is happening within this
life, that same change will happen in the next life. So, if a child grows up. Or
if an adult becomes a senior citizen. All that it means is there is a change.
But there is something that is continuous, also. So, the continuity that
persists despite the change, what causes that continuity? Now, in the case of a
computer, I was using a different contina..., computer. Now, I am using a
different computer, say. So, then the case, "I" and the user are the same. Now,
similarly, if I am going to use a computer, which I, has got certain parts
changed. Then, some part of the computer is same. Some part of the computer has
changed. But the user is still the same. So, same way with the body. If, that
the body has changed partially, subtly, or completely, and dras..., rapidly. It
does not make much difference. The fact is the user remains the same. So, "dehi"
is the person who is occupying the body. So, naturally, with the previous was,
that, oh, none of these kings will die. Nor will you die. Never was there a time
when these kings did not exist. I did not exist. You did not exist. All of us
are going to exist in the future, also. So, this immediately raises the
question. How is that possible? Actually, either those, some of those kings,
some of those kings are definitely going to die on the battlefield. So, how can
everybody stay alive? So, Krishna is answering that, there is, there is
something within the body that will stay alive. The body is, will change. And do
not get so worked up by the changes. Because such changes are seen everywhere,
even in this life. So, just as we do not get unduly worked up by the changes
from komara to yovana, and yovana to jara. Similarly, do not get too worked up
about the change from jara to the next body.

        tathā dehāntara-prāptir

So, after mentioning in the previous verse that there is an individual, you
know, that all of us are individuals eternally. He explains what does all of us
refer to. He says, it refers to the "dehi". And then, now, Arjuna gets a
question over here. Yes, that is fine. It, even if I accept this. But still, you
know, I am concerned. I am concerned that my relatives, you know, they will no
longer be there with me. We will die. And I will be the cause of their death.
So, what will happen after that? So, then He says that yes. What will happen is
that, you will have to learn tolerance. That is the next verse. 

        mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya
        śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ
        āgamāpāyino ’nityās
        tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata

So, "mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya". So, "mātrā-sparśās", the contact to the senses
with the sense objects. "tu kaunteya". So, again, K..., Krishna is referring to
Arjuna by, by forms of address, which are connected with his body. "kaunteya"
and "bhārata". So, it is paradoxical that just in the previous three verses,
repeatedly, the bodily conception has been condemned. So, first was, Arjuna, you
are speaking learned words. But you are, actually, your emotions are showing
that you are uneducated. Then, the next verse says that we are all eternal. And
this v..., 13 verse said that there is the so..., something within the body, the
"dehi", that is eternal. And that will be occupied by another body. So, then,
why is it that, here, Krishna is referring to Arjuna by names which are
connected with the body? "kaunteya". "bhārata". So, "kaunteya" refers to him by
the son of Kuntī. "bhārata" refers to the descendant of the Bharata dynasty. So,
of course, there are multiple levels of understanding at this. We could, at a
spiritual level, we could say Kuntī is a great devotee. Bharata. Then, that
dy..., dynasty, there were great devotees in the past, also. And because of
that, those dynasties are illustrious. And somebody's monstrous dynasty, then
that, that, that, that identification of the dynasty does not have to be
material. It can be spiritual. Because one is remembering the dynasty for the
sake of remembering Krishna. And the remembrance of the dynasty increases one's
remembrance of Krishna. So, that is one way of looking at it. And whenever there
are names which are connected with great devotees, then that is, that is one way
we can look at it. But there will be other places where, like in the next verse,
2.15 will have:

        yaṁ hi na vyathayanty ete
        puruṣaṁ puruṣarṣabha

So, "puruṣaṁ puruṣarṣabha". Best among the "puruṣa"s. So, "deha-bhṛtāṁ vara".
Similarly, later on in the Bhagavad Gita, we will have "deha-bhṛtāṁ vara". That
one who is the best among those who have acquired bodies. So, we may say, this
is, this is complete bodily conception. Isn't it? No. Again, the point is that,
anyway, that the person's swa..., spiritual inspiration can be initiated and
sustained. That is good for that person. So, by the practice of respectful honor
prefix being used, people are inspired to act honorably. And by thus being
inspired to act honorably, they raise upwards. They move upwards in their
spiritual life. So, the point is to elevate people. The point is to enable
people to move onwards in their spiritual lives. And to act dharmically. So,
"kaunteya" and "bhārata" are used to m..., make, oh, you belong to such an
illustrious dyna..., dynasties. You must act honorably. So, we discussed in our
Isopanishad course how we should not pinch the false ego, nor inflate the false
ego. We should pat the false ego along. Yes. You belong to a great family. Then,
act g..., act greatly, now, act in a great way. So, "mātrā-sparśās". What is
this "mātrā-sparśās"? "sparśās" is contact. "mātrā" is the sense objects,
material things which comprise the sense objects. So, "mātrā-sparśās" refers to
the contact with the material senses. So, sen..., sense objects contact with the
material senses, at that time, there can be various dualities. There can be
"śītoṣṇa". There can be "sukha-duḥkha". Happiness and distress. Heat and cold.
Now, one understands that this is "āgamāpāyino ’nityās". There is a beginning.
There is an end. And therefore, this is temporary. And because of that, one
should tolerate it. "tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata". So, in some cases, you know,
f..., know, there are some leeches, or some bloodsucking animals. So, if they
come to suck the blood. So, at that time, actually, if you, they just get such a
deadly crib on the b..., on the skin that if you try to rip, it, pull them
apart, they will hold onto the skin. And they will die holding onto the skin.
And if you try to pull them out, actually, they will rip the whole skin out with
it. You know, you know, so, in many, otherwise, actually, they have, they have
some small tubules which they want to fill with blood. That is their filling
basically. So, if we let those tubules get filled. Then, after that, they
themselves let go. And just gently, a tapped, also, they will fall away. Before
that, you had to bring them out. You had to rip apart. So, like that, now, of
course, that does not mean that if leeches are biting us, we just have to
passively watch on. 20:12
