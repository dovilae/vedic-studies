Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhakti Shastri, Bhagavad Gita course. We are
in, you know, the concluding section of the Fourth Chapter. Krishna has talked
about various forms of "yajña" by which one can acquire knowledge. And now, He
will talk about how ultimately, you know, the knowledge gives us various and
glorious fruits. So, let us look at these fruits of knowledge. So, we will look
at this first. We will look at the overview of the Fourth Chapter. So, here, we
have, there are five sections in the Fourth Chapter. We have discussed four of
those sections. The first section is Kricha..., Krishna teaches and establishes
dharma. So, He teaches:

        imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ

establishes, you know, pa...:

        dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya
        sambhavāmi yuge yuge

Then, you know, dharma involves various paths. So, Krishna is the goal of all
those paths. And He is the creator, of, also, those paths. Then, Krishna is
recommending that the dharma that Arjuna follow is karma-yoga. You know, because
karma-yoga will eventually lead to liberation as is in, done by many people in
the past. So, then, Krishna says, how while acting, one will get liberation.
That is because one acts in "yajña". So, even we act in sacrifice, that
sacrifice leads to development of knowledge, to "jñāna". So, the, it is actually
25 from 33 is achieving "jñāna" through sacrifices. So, connection between the
third and the fourth section is that, karma-yoga itself is one way to develop
"jñāna". And in general, there are various ways by which, various "ya...",
"yajña"s by which one can develop "jñāna". So, "yajñāyācarataḥ karma". Krishna
had told in 4.23rd verse that act for "yajña". So, now, after describing how
"jñāna" can be acquired in various ways. Now, in the last section, 34 to 42,
Krishna, which of these ways should one follow? That one has to inquire from a
spiritual master. So, by going to a spiritual master, we acquire transcendental
knowledge. So, now, this last section will talk about how to acquire
transcendental knowledge. And what the results of that transcendental knowledge
are. So, let us begin with the 34th verse which is a well-known verse. Which
Srila Prabhupada would frequently quote:

        tad viddhi praṇipātena
        paripraśnena sevayā
        upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ
        jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ

So, "tad viddhi". That knowledge. "tad" refers to that. What is that? What was
talked about in the previous verse, 4.33 verse? "jñāne parisamāpyate". So, that,
all kn..., knowled..., all fo..., forms of "yajña". "sarva...":

        sarvaṁ karmākhilaṁ pārtha
        jñāne parisamāpyate

That all kind of work that is done. And all the sacrifices that are involved in
that work. They all culminate in knowledge. So, how one can acquire know...,
know..., knowledge? "tad viddhi", can know it by three things. "praṇi...",
"praṇipātena". "paripraśnena". "sevayā". "praṇipātena" is submission.
"paripraśnena" is inqui..., inquisitiveness. And "sevayā" is service my...,
service attitude, service. So, then, "upadekṣyanti". So, "upadekṣyanti" is
related with "upade", is, "upades" to give instruction. So, Prabhupada
translates it as they will initiate you. "te jñānaṁ". They will initiate you to
that knowledge. "upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ". "jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ".
"tattva-darśinaḥ" is those who are the seers of truth. So, because the focus
here is on "jñāna". So, Krishna does not talk about bhakta. He does not say
bhaktinaṁ. He says "jñāninas". Why? Because the, Krishna will later on say how
all "jñāna" culminates in bhakti. "jñānavān māṁ prapadyate". He will explain in
7.19. At this stage, Krishna has not introduced bhakti directly. So, He is
focusing on "jñāninas". He is focusing on how karma-yoga will lead to "jñāna".
And that "jñāna", when it is developed, it will lead to liberation. So, how one
gets that "jñāna"? By going to spiritual master. And if you want "jñāna". Then,
the spiritual master should have "jñāna". That is why "jñāninas". Now,
interestingly, if we remember from the Third Chapter when Krishna is talking
about how lust covers the living entity's intelligence. So, at that time, He
says in 3.39:

        āvṛtaṁ jñānam etena
        jñānino nitya-vairiṇā

So, He describes, all living entities to be "jñānina". So, all of us are
sat-cit-ananda as souls. All of us are "jñānis". We all have knowledge. But
currently, our knowledge is covered. The spiritual master is a person who has
been able to uncover that conditioning. Uncover, remove that conditioning that
is there. And therefore has become "jñāninas". The spiritual, so, the soul is by
nature "jñāni". But the, but because of the covering of lust, "āvṛtaṁ jñānam",
the soul, soul becomes like a "jñāni". But the spiritual master is one who has
removed the covering. "jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ". So, because, this, so, the
spiritual master is "jñāni", sp..., spiritual master has seen the truth.
"tattva-darśinaḥ". Has seen the truth. So, after seeing the truth, He can
explain the truth to us. Now, let us look at this verse a little bit more in
detail. Especially, three things that we have to do. "praṇipātena".
"paripraśnena". And "sevayā". So. Hmm. I write a, daily articles on the Bhagavad
Gita. There is a part of the Gita daily. So, here, there is an article on this,
you know, theme of 4.34. So, tap His grace by humbleness, inquisitiveness, and
service-mindedness. So, you know, so, His grace is Krishna's grace. And
humbleness is "praṇipātena". Inquisitiveness is "paripraśnena". And
service-mindedness is "sevayā". So:

        tad viddhi praṇipātena
        paripraśnena sevayā

So, the spiritual master is like a coach for us. The spiritual master is a
coach. Coach means that the spiritual master gives us guidance on how we can
advance in spiritual master. So, what is humbleness? Humbleness means to admit
that I do not know the way. "praṇipātena". Why should we go down in bow?
"praṇipāta" means to actually offer obeisances. To bow down. Fall down. So:

"As we can’t discern the internal landscape, we need indispensably an attitude
of humbleness: “I don’t know the way; you do. Please be my guide”."

So, actually, spiritual journey is essentially an inner journey. We want to move
inwards. You know. The soul is inside. We are the soul. But we are not aware
that we are the soul. So, redirect our consciousness inwards. And realise that
we are the soul. And then, after that, we have to realise that the soul is
eternally connected with Krishna. And in, case, Krishna in, said, also. So, we,
we have, make an inner journey. But we cannot see things inside. So, therefore,
we need to know the way. So, the spiritual master knows the way. And the
spiritual master provides us the way. So, humbleness. Just as when we, you know,
you know, go to a doctor. We are humble. You know. I am sick. I do not know what
is the cause of the sickness. You know. Please, I have come to tell you. So,
actually, if a patient, a, pro..., imagines that I know better than the doctor.
The patient cannot be treated by the doctor. So, humbleness is required.  And
humbleness alone is not enough. If we just k..., phew, fall in front of the
spiritual master. Yes. But have to inquire. Inquire. You know. What is wrong?
You know, so, as Sanatana Goswami inquired, he. You know. You know. What i...,
why am I?

         ‘ke āmi’, ‘kene āmāya jāre tāpa-traya’

Why am I suffering from the threefold mise..., threefold miseries of material
existence? This, something, which is a vital inquiry for everyone. And that is
inquisitiveness. So:

"This injunction of the Gita indicates that it calls not for blind faith in the
name of humbleness, but for a development of our capacity for spiritual
perception. By this perception, we start seeing for ourselves what the guru is
seeing."

This means we, when we inquire from the spiritual master, we d..., gradually, by
inquire, we develop jnana chakshu. We develop our capacity for spiritual
perception. We start perceiving the spiritual realm. Does not mean suddenly, we
start seeing sat-cit-ananda atma everywhere. That will happen eventually when we
develop spiritual version, also. But we develop, you know, you know, the
capacity for deep thinking. And deep thinking also leads to deeper observations.
So, we can see this world, how the promises of this world are false. And how, we
can see basically in the world that the truth of the Gita being demonstrated.
And we start seeing for ourselves what the guru is seeing. So, h..., hu...,
after humbleness, there is inquisitiveness. So, the spiritual master tells, this
world is a place of misery. But then, I see, there is so many advertisements.
In the advertisements, all people are smiling. All people are laughing. In the
movies, people are laughing. And all the novels have happy endings. So, yes.
This world is a place of happiness. But, so, the world seems to tell us. And
when gradually, we start seeing beyond the surface. I look in the roads. We
see, the advertisement, people are, are smiling. But look down on the road,
everybody is sulking, frowning, scowling. So, where are actually people happy?
In real life, few people are, few people, if any, are happy. And even if they
are happy, that is for short time. This world is actually "duḥkhālayam". So,
we start seeing for ourselves what the guru is seeing. That happens by
inquisitiveness. So, humbleness is definitely important. So that we can learn.
But humbleness alone is not enough. Humbleness is a launching pad for learning.
For developing our own spiritual vision. And, now, it is good to, you know,
admit that we do not know. And then, to get to know. Doctor, I do not know what
is wrong with me. You know. Doc..., please tell me what is my sickness. After
that, the important thing is to take the medicine. If we do not take the
medicine even if we know in exhaustive detail the diagnosis that we are, of
the disease that we are suffering from. Still, just knowledge does not cure us.
There has to be, you know, taking of the prescription. Application. So, that is.
That application essentially is "sevayā", service-mindedness.

"The destination of our spiritual journey is the realization that loving service
to Krishna is our only source of lasting fulfillment. We progress towards that
realization by serving Krishna as per the guru’s instructions."

So, when we, you know, what is the ultimate realisation that we need? That I am
not the body. I am the soul. That Krishna has got. Yes, all these are important
realisations. The most transformational realisation of our live will be that
Krishna and Krishna alone is the source of the best enjoyment. Everything else
that promises enjoyment will ultimately lead to suffering. Service to Krishna
will grant me greater and better fulfillment than anything else in this world.
Once we get this realisation, once we get this conviction, then, the temptations
of this world will no longer allure us. And how do we get this? By actually
living according to it. So, we may not feel so much satisfaction in loving
Krishna right now. But if we keep serving Krishna. Keep serving Krishna. You
know, with a, as much of an affection and attitude, devotional attitude that we
can have. Then, gradually, by this, you know, we will develop our affection for
Krishna. And we will get realisation, also. That we get getter happi..., better
happiness in serving Krishna than in anything else. So, so, now, a, to
summarise.

"Thus, HIS grace works in three progressive steps:"

What is?

"humbleness enables the guru to show us the way, inquisitiveness enables us to
start seeing the way ourselves and service-mindedness enables us to move along
the way."

There are three steps. By humbleness. If I am not humble, then the guru cannot
show me, only, what is the way. So, I am humble. I do not know. Please tell me.
Humbleness enables the guru to show us the way. Inquisitiveness enables to start
seeing the way ourselves. To internalise what the guru is telling us. And
service-mindedness, we actually start moving. So, guru tells us. You are not the
body. You are the soul. Soul is servant of Krishna. Inquisitiveness helps us to
understand this more. And then, acting on this devot..., spiritual devotional
platform of serving Krishna moves us towards retu..., re..., becoming reinstated
in our eternal spiritual position. So, in this way, Krishna:

        tad viddhi praṇipātena
        paripraśnena sevayā

By these three, we get the spiritual knowledge. So, let us look at, you know,
Srila Prabhupada's purport, also. So, Prabhupada starts by telling:

"The path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difﬁcult."

Undoubtedly difficult. Why? Now, we will say bhakti is easy to perform. Yes.
But in general, bhakti i..., i..., is the easiest among the various spiritual
paths. And the spiritual paths in general are difficult. So, why are they
difficult? Because we have to fight our inner demons. We have to fight against
lust, anger, greed, envy, pride, and illusion. And they are formidable forces
which want to keep us enslaved. So that we keep serving them life after life
after life. So, therefore, we need the guidance of a guru. And Prabhupada
explains that mental speculation, a:

"mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help lead one to the right path. Nor
by independent study of books of knowledge can one progress in spiritual life."

So, these can give us some preliminary knowledge. But ul..., these can give us
some preliminary knowledge. We can read books. We can think for ourselves. All
this is, you know, it can be a, a slight movement along the right path. But if
one wants serious progress on the right path, that we need a spiritual master.
Now, a, what exactly, so Prabhupada, now, significantly makes the point that,
actually, the spiritual master tests the disciple to see if the spiri...,
disciple is sincere, disciple is serious. And when the disciple is serious, then
the spiritual master accepts a, in Krishna Consciousness, the, the testing is
standardised in terms of, say, having, you know, of chanting 16 rounds, following
four regulative principles for one year or whatever. You know, the period may be
depending on one's spiritual master. But one year is generally the standard,
minimum. And then, like that, the spiritual master is testing the disciple. And
the disciple also needs to test the spiritual master. You know, in today's
society, there are so many people who claim to be spiritual masters. And one has
to be able to test, you know, who is the bonafide spiritual master. And by that,
one moves forward. Then, now, what exactly is the spiritual master's role? The
spiritual master actually is th..., you know, is enabling us to turn towards
Krishna. How? Through his own example. And through his connection with Krishna.
So, the parampara. The spiritual master has to come in parampara. The m..., we
are not going to go into all the qualifications. But this chapter itself talked
earlier in 4.2 of:

        evaṁ paramparā-prāptam

The spiritual master's, you know, very defining qualification is that, he is in,
he is in parampara. So, now, parampara, is not just a link of head. You know, a
link not just of head. But a link of hearts. What does it mean? You know. What
does it mean link of hearts? Actually, it is not that, if we look at Srila
Prabhupada's books. And we look at Bhak..., Bhaktisiddhanta Saravasti's books.
If we, we will see that, there is a world of difference. Not in content. But in
presentation. In style. In, you know, in m..., manner of approach. Prabhupada
was a distinct individual. Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura was a distinct
individual. So, it is not that, the ci..., disciple is going to repeat verbatim
as it is. Like a robo. Or like a recorder. Whatever one has heard. Just repeats
it. That can also be done in situations where it is required. But the important
point is that, that is not what defines a spiritual master. The spiritual master
lives the principles that are taught in scriptures. And there have been, the
disciple sees how the spiritual master is living according to principles of
selfless sacrifice. Then, the spiri..., the disciple gets inspired. When the
disciple gets inspired to live according to those same s..., principles. Then,
what happens? The principle of selfless devotion, that is present in the heart
of the spiritual master. That gets transferred to the heart of the disciple. And
when it gets transferred to the heart of the disciple, then their hearts get
linked. So, the, the parampara is a link of hearts. Hearts linked together in
the principle of selfless devotion. So, then, when the disciple becomes this
inspired and exalted, then this disciple will become a spiritual master. And
that spiritual master example will inspire prospective disciples. Who will also
become inspired, and transformed, and elevated by the principle of selfless
devotion. Selfless devotion here is bhakti devi, bhakti, you know. So, bhakti
what links the disciplic succession. The parampara is a link of heart. It is a
link of hearts based on the principle of bhakti, selfless devotion. And then,
what does the parampara do? Actually, the connection with parampara, piety
transforms into spirituality when there is a connection to the guru and a
commitment to the process. So, many people may have piety. Piety means they may
have some belief in being good, do good. We should not be sinful. We should not
be immoral. We should not be,  do illegal, illicit activities. So, that piety
is there. Piety is good. But piety in and of itself is not spirituality. Piety
is in goodness. Impiety can be in the lower modes. Passion, ignorance. Piety is
in goodness. But spirituality is above. It is transcendental. So, piety
transforms into spirituality when there is a connection to the guru. Connection
to the guru and a commitment to the process. There is a connection to the guru
and a commitment to the process. One becomes connected with the spiritual
master. And after that connection, one commits oneself. Yes, I am going to serve
my spiritual master. And that commitment is to:

        tad viddhi praṇipātena
        paripraśnena sevayā

Then, by that, one becomes purified. And one becomes, you know, spiritually
conscious, spiritually advanced. So, now, some people say that, actually, you
know, I have a direct relationship with God. I want to have a direct
relationship with God. Why I have to, why should a guru come in-between me and
God? I do not want him be in-between me and God. So, actually, what is the
guru's role? The guru does not come in-between us and God. But he removes what
is between us and God. That is the wall of our own false ego. The law of our,
the wall of our own misconceptions and misconceived desires. You know. So, what
is this? You know, actually, th..., th..., the soul is here. Krishna is here.
The two are neighbors. That there is the famous verse which talks about two
birds in the tree. So, the soul and Supersoul are right next to each other in
the heart. But there is a wall. The wall is of misconceptions. The soul thinks
that I am indepen..., I am independent living being. I am the body. And I can
enjoy at the bodily level. And based on that misconceptions, there are
misconceived desires. Misdirected desires. And those misdirected desires take
the soul's consciousne..., away from Krishna. So, what does the spiritual master
do? Spiritual master gives the disciple the knowledge and the process by which
that wall can be broken down. Gives knowledge by which those misconceptions are
shattered. Yes, I am a part of Krishna. I meant to love and serve Krishna. And
also, the misdirected desires which take the soul's consciousness away from
Krishna. That ch..., you know, guru gives the prin..., you know, principle of,
you know, chanting of the holy names. And remembrance of Krishna which purifies
and redirects our desires away from the world and back towards Krishna. In this
way, the wall breaks. The guru does not come between us and, you know, the,
disci..., you know, kind..., Krishna. He removes what is bin..., between us and
Krishna. And not only that. What does the spiritual master do? The spiritual
master ultimately connects us with Krishna. So, without the spiritual master, we
will not know what is authentic bhakti. Therefore, spiritual master is
essential. And some people say that, you know, I do not need a guru. Hmm. I am
my own guru. So, hmm, he, who is his own guru has a fool as his disciple. So,
he, who is his own guru. If I am my own guru. Then, who is my disciple? That is
a fool. So, I am my own disciple, also. Then, I am a fool basically if I.
Because we cannot, you know, change ourselves. We cannot cure ourselves by our
own efforts. So, Krishna is there in our heart. But Krishna loves us devotees.
Somebody may ask, cannot Krishna make Himself accessible directly? If Krishna
loves me, why it is Krishna want me to go to a guru? you know. Krishna can
gi..., reveal Himself to me directly. Who is? Who, who are we? Who? Why cannot
Krishna can do that? Krishna can do anything. 21:28
