Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhakti Shastri, Bhagavad Gita course. We are
now in the fourth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, about to start with some of the
most well-known verses in the Bhagavad Gita. In fact, among all the verses,
this is a verse pair, that is most well-known. There are other verses which are
well-known, like "karmaṇy evādhikāras te". Or "yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham". But two
successive verses, that are the most well-known within the Vedic context as well
as outside the, what we could call the Hindu world. This, this ver...,
successive verse pair is the most well-known. Let us look at these two verses.

        yadā yadā hi dharmasya
        glānir bhavati bhārata
        abhyutthānam adharmasya
        tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham

So, "yadā yadā". "yadā yadā". Two "yadā" have meaning. Wherever and whenever,
Prabhupada translates. That means at different times and at different places.
"yadā yadā hi dharmasya". "dharma". "glāniḥ". So, "glāniḥ" means decline or
disruption. Or as Prabhupada translates as discrepancies. "bhavati bhārata".
Whenever there is a decline in religion. So, Prabhupada translates that as
decline in the sentence translation. And discrepancies in the word to word
translation. And then, "abhyutthānam adharmasya". "abhyutthānam" means increase,
predominance. So, when there is a decline in religion and increase in
irreligion. "tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham". "tadātmānaṁ". Therefore, I myself
manifest. "sṛjāmy". So, now, in the previous verse, Krishna has said that He,
He, 4.4 was Arjuna's question. How can, how could you have instructed the
sun-god? And Krishna says in 4.5 that I remem..., I remember all my previous
lives. You do not. And then, He says, He says, He talks about His own position.
And He states in 4.6 that, actually, I remember, because, you know, My body is
transcendental. I am the Lord of all living beings. And I come by my own nature.
In My own transcendental form. By My mercy. So:

        prakṛtiṁ svām adhiṣṭhāya
        sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā

So, this is a mystery of the Lord's appearance. Now, the Lord will describe why
He appears in this world. So, or, first, He is talking about when He appears.
And next verse, He will tell, wha..., why He appears. Actually, in this verse
itself, the why He appears is implicit. So, He is saying that, you know, that
there is always this tension between dharma and adharma in this world. You know,
that is there within our hearts. We have a good side and a bad side. We have
virtuous side and a vicious side. Or, as a native Americans would s..., say
that there is a good dog within us and a bad dog within us. So, both the dogs
are barking. Prompting us to act either in good ways or bad ways. So, this is
always there within our hearts. The conflict between what some, you know,
scholars call as the higher self and the lower self. So, there is this conflict
going on. And this same conflict is reflected in the external world as a
conflict between good and evil. So, the people whose g..., good side is c...,
dominated by the bad side. They become adharmic. And those whose bad side is
dominated by the good sides. They are dharmic. So, now, of course, good and bad,
you know, different people may have different conceptions of that. What is
actually good, and what is actually bad, we have to look at scripture to
understand that. You know, but the point is, there is dharma. And Krishna is
saying when the "dharmasya glānir". When there is a decline of religion. Now,
the word dharma has multiple meanings. So, normally, Srila Prabhupada would say
that dharma refers to our essential nature. So, for example, dharma of water is
liquidity. The dharma of fire is heat and light. Dharma of sugar is sweetness.
That is true. So, that is one meaning of dharma. But the word dharma is not
univalent. It is multivalent. Multivalent means, it has multiple meanings.
Univalent means it has only one meaning. So, the word dharma has multiple
meanings. So, for example, when Krishna says "sarva-dharmān parityajya". So,
give up all varieties of religion. So, if dharma is our essential nature,
then how can we give up dharma? How can Krishna tell us to give up all dharmas
in fact? So, we have to understand that the word dharma can refer to multiple
things. Essentially, it refers to three different things. At the ultimate level,
it refers to essential nature which is to love and serve Krishna. That is a
spiritual nature. Then, but we are not at the spiritual level of consciousness
right now. So, we are at the material level of consciousness. So, when we are at
the material level of consciousness, we have material dharma. The material
dharma is what is given to us by varanashram. And that material dharma keeps us
in harmony with the, you know, world around us. And fulfills our necessities in
a way that does not disrupt the environment. And does not disrupt our spiritual
prospects. So, dharma, artha, kama, moksha is a progression. So, that is the
dharma at the conditioned level. Prabhupada talks about is conditioned dharma.
Material dharma. Sva-dharma. So, for example, bra..., so..., some people may be
brahmana. Some people may be vaisyas like that. That is material dharma. And
then, there is transitional. Transitional means, now, varanashram, in and of
itself, will purify. But it is a gradual process. So, what we are practicing
sadhana-bhakti. Sadhana-bhakti is also a dharma. Sadhana-bhakti is not our
eternal dharma. Bhakti is eternal. But sadhana-bhakti, where we have to struggle
against our mind and senses, and fix them on Krishna, that is not necessarily
eter..., that is not eternal. That struggle will go on as long as we do not
become purified. Once we become purified, that struggle is no longer there. So,
there is a transitional dharma. So, there is here, in material conc..., at the
material level, we have dharma. That is the social order. Then, there is, there
is, we could say sadhana-bhakti. That is also a dharma. That is also a duty. So,
chanting Hare Krishna even if we do not feel like chanting. This will elevate
us. This will take us from the material level of consciousness to the spiritual
level consciousness, ultimately. So, that is also a dharma. So, here, when
Krishna is referring to "dharmasya glānir". He is not referring to this level of
dharma. This level is what? The spiritual level where the idea is that one is, I
am a soul. And I am a servant of Krishna. That is all that I have to do. I love
Krishna. And I will serve him. That dharma is inalianable. And that dharma
cannot be disrupted. But Krishna is here referring to the social arrangement by
which people practice dharma. So, the social arrangement by which people
practice the principles of, you know, the spiritualities. "dharmasya glanir"
means that predominance of irreligion and the subordination, the subjugation of
religion. When sva, "dharmasya glānir" happens. Then, "paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ".
Then, Krishna will describe, what ha..., you know, what f..., he will be doing
in the next verse. But here, He says, "tadatmanam srjamy aham". At that time, I
appear. So, now, Prabhupada's purport focuses on the word "srjami".

"The word srjami is signiﬁcant herein."

What is significance of "srjami"?

"Srjami cannot be used in the sense of creation, because, according to the
previous verse, there is no creation of the Lord’s form or body, since all of
the forms are eternally existent. Therefore, srjami means that the Lord
manifests Himself as He is."

So, again, the point is that, "srjami" can, you know, mean creation. But just
like for the gopis, and for the relationship of Krishna and gopis. Sometimes,
the word kama is used. Now, hmm, actually, the relationship of Krishna with the
gopis, is not based on material lust. So, kama, when it is used over there does
not convey the sensual, selfish, grossly physical, you know, craving that
characterises the male-female attraction in this world. That refers to, m...,
it refer..., that kama refers to the pure spiritual selfless attraction that is
there between the pure devotees and Krishna. Between gopis and Krishna. And
because that relationship is so intense, you know, that, to give us an inkling
of that, to gi..., what is the nature of that relationship? The word kama is
used. So, when terms are used. We also have to understand that, sometimes, we
have certain baggage which we carry in our mind. And because of that, we pursue
terms in a particular way. But, you know, this, so, scriptures do clarify. For
example, many times, we are describing Krishna's rasa-lila. The word kama may
be used. But then, at the end of the Rasa Panchadhyayi, in the last verse, in
33rd Chapter, 39th verse, it says that, 10.33.39, it says that, actually, if one
hears rasa-lila, one will become free from kama. So, it says:

        vikrīḍitaṁ vraja-vadhūbhir idaṁ ca viṣṇoḥ
        śraddhānvito ’nuśṛṇuyād atha varṇayed yaḥ
        bhaktiṁ parāṁ bhagavati pratilabhya kāmaṁ
        hṛd-rogam āśv apahinoty acireṇa dhīraḥ

So, "kāmaṁ hṛd-rogam". That the, you know, the heart, the disease of lust will
be removed, will be cleansed. So, the point is clear from the whole context,
narration of the Bha..., Bhag..., the Rasa Panchadhyayi that this is meant to
remove lust. If it is meant to remove lust, then how can the attraction between
Krishna and the gopis be lust? You know, if we rehear about lust, others
engaging lusty activities, that does not r..., remove lust from our heart. That
increases the lust in our heart. So, the word lust may be used. But the word
lust does not mean, you know, kama does n..., n..., not, sorry, lust, the word
kama may be used. But kama does not refer to lust as we know it here. So,
similarly, "sṛjāmi", the word is used, the point is the Lord manifests Himself.
The Lord is, it is not that the Lord's form is created. In the previous verse,
only, here, said there, the Lord, is it, form is eternal. "avyayātmā". "ajaḥ".
"prakṛtiṁ svām". So, He has made things very clear. Now, Prabhupada explains
then, what is dharma. So then, at one level, dharma means transcendental nature.
But Prabhupada also says:

        dharmam tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam

So, dharma is that which is given by God. "bhagavat-pranitam". This is the
definition which, you know, comes in the Sixth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam when
Yamaraja is instructing, you know, the whole passing of Ajamil come. And
Yamaraja, yamadutas, Vishnudatas. There are various discussions going on over
there. Now, you know, the principles of God, there are spec..., there are
prin..., there, there are specifics which may vary. But the essential principle
is the same. And the essential message is the same. That the Lord wants the
souls to return back to Him. The Lord wants the souls who are His children, who
have gone away from Him to return back to Him. And for that purpose, whatever is
required, He is, whatever is required, He does that. So, He creates, He gives
dharm..., He gives scriptures. He gives the various, you know, spiritual
manifestations such as holy places, holy names, holy days. But along with that,
He also gives many other things that is He gives essentially the principle of,
you know, His own manifestation. So, Prabhupada writes in the purport that He,
so, He incarnates, some "srjami". "srjamy aham". So, he says that in this,
Prabhupada says, it is not only that the Lord Himself comes. So, Prabhupada
says, it, Prabhupada includes Buddha, also, in this. Hmm:

"Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His bona ﬁde
representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised
form."

So, he descends personally, that is referring to the incarnation of Krishna. He
sends His bona fide representative in the form of His son. So, here, Prabhupada
is referring to Jesus. And sometimes, in some disguised form. So, that is
referring to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, channa-avatar. And now, Prabhupada gives
that that, actually, the mission is the same. Although externally, the mission
may appear to be different. So, he gives the example of Buddha. Contextually,
circumstantially, because of the kind of mentality in, you know, soc..., you
know, culture that was present at His times, Buddha had to superficially reject
the Vedas. But eventually, his purpose was to elevate people. So, he rejected
the Veda externally. But he made people follow certain principles. Which he was
giving. And so, he is then God. So, by following him, also people become
elevated. You know, at least from the lower modes to goodness. So, now, here,
the Lord's incarnations are described as many. In fact, the Bhagavatam says the
Lord's incarnations are innumerable. There are as many as are the waves in an
ocean. Why are the Lord's incarnations unlimited? Because His love for us is
unlimited. And that is why, you know, "sambhavāmi yuge yuge". That will come in
the next verse. "yuge yuge". Every yuga, He will keep coming. Again. And again.
And again. So, this actually reveals Krishna's compassion far more than the idea
that of certain exclusivist religions. That this particular person is the last
messenger of God. This particular person is the only way to God. So, these
ideas, they, you know, actually do not do justice to the glory of God. Because
if God is great. God is infinite. Then, why will God make the way to Him only
one? And restrict it? 14:06
