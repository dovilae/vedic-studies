Hare Krishna. Welcome to our Bhagavad Gita study, the part of the Bhakti Shastri
course. Today, we are discussing the third chapter. And we are going into the
section, the fourth section, which discusses about how karma-yoga is different
from karma-kanda. Karma-kanda causes bondage. Karma-yoga does not cause bondage.
So, 3.25 and 26 talked about the contrast between the "vidvāṁ" and "asaktāḥ".
Those who are enlightened and detached as contrasted with those who are ignorant
and attached. "avidvāṁ" and "saktāḥ". So, now, what is the difference between
these two? That will be talked in the next three verses. So, the 3.27, which we
will discuss today is a famous verse. Prabhupada would quote this quite
frequently.

        prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni
        guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ
        ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā
        kartāham iti manyate

So, "prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni". "kriyamāṇāni" means being done. "kriya" is action.
So, "kriyamāṇāni" is being done. So, that which is done by "prakṛteḥ".

        prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni
        guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ

So, the "guṇaiḥ"s of "prakṛteḥ". They do the actions. "ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā". The
conditioned soul is "vimūḍhā", is deluded by "ahaṅkāra". "ahaṅkāra" is ego.
"kartā", "aham". Thinks that I am the doer. "iti manyate". One who thinks. Now,
what does this verse actually mean? You know, if it says that everything is done
by the three modes, then what is, what is the reason or rationale for the
Bhagavad Gita telling Arjuna do this, do not do this? Act in this way. Do not
act in this way. What would be the logic for all this if the Bhagavad Gita were
actually telling this their, message that everything is done by the three modes?
So, actually, the scriptures, you know, give philosophy within a context. And
the context has to be understood. So, the important point in this is, here, that
the modes are the doer. And the soul, who thinks that I am the doer is a, is
deluded, is "vimūḍhā". The important point is to understand that the soul is not
the only doer. The oul is..., soul is definitely a doer. But the soul is not the
only doer. The soul is one of the doers. So, let us consider this now. You know,
the soul is one of the doers. What does it mean? It essentially means that the
soul is, you know, initiating the action. Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa used the
example in Vedanta Sutra that a woodcutter cuts trees. So, in his
Govinda-bhāṣya, explains that when a woodcutter cuts the tree. Who is actually
cutting the three? It is not the woodcutter. It is the axe. So, without the axe,
if the woodcutter goes and starts hitting with the hands. The woodcutter will
not be able to cut the tree. So, for cutting a tree, the tool, that is the axe,
is essential. So, the cutter of the tree is actually the axe. But at the same
time, the axe will not move on its own. The axe has the capacity to cut. But the
axe does not have the consciousness by which to decide whether to cut or to not
cut. So, the axe moves because there is a conscious being who desires to cut a
tree. So, therefore, now, among these two that the woodcutter decides, desiring
and deciding to cut the tree. And the acts being used to cut the tree. Which are
important? Which is important? Both are important. You know, it depends on the
context. So, similarly, when we talk about b..., b..., our actions in this
world. So, for example, right now, I am speaking. So, how am I speaking? It is
through the body. The voice boxes producing some sound. So, there is basically
the organ of speech which is enabling me to speak. So, now, without this organ
of speech, I will not be able to speak. At the same time, even if that organ of
speech is present, if I do not have the desire to speak, I will not, or...,
speak. No sound will come out. So, the organ of speech is like the tool for
speaking. And the soul is the person. Soul is like the woodcutter. So, both of
them have to come together and speak. Now, this is with respect to normal
actions. Which we do. When Krishna is talking about here, He says that,
actually, our actions, the way we are inclined to act. And the way we, the, act,
it is largely determined by the three modes. So, somebody walks very
passionately, in a very driven way to achieve something. So, somebody decides
that I want to climb up Mount Everest. And then, works very hard. Trains.
Develops a lot of muscle and stamina. And then, starts the climb. And there is a
lot of courage despite the danger and, you know, a, possible disaster.

And sl..., keeps persevering, persevering, perse..., finally climbed up Mount
Everest. So, who actually did the climbing? It was the person, the soul or was
it body? It is the body that did the climbing. The body is the tool. And the
body is governed by the laws of material nature. The body being governed by the
laws of material nature. You know. The soul has a particular s..., kind of
desires which also are governed by material nature. Not governed entirely. But
generally, for the soul, the gamut of choice of desires is determined by
material nature. What does it mean? Suppose, a student gets an exam. The
competitive exam. Get the, what is the capital of India? Moscow, Washington,
London. Three option. Say. The, no fourth option. These, you know, the, now,
these are the capital, what should I do? You know, that is all options. You have
to take only one of them. What will you do then? So, actually, here, whichever
answer this is, the student chooses. It is wrong. Because all the answers are
wrong. So, like that, what happens to the conditioned soul is that when the soul
is disconnected from Krishna, the soul gets caught within material nature. And
what material nature? Ok, What do you want to do? How do you want to act? In
ignorance. In passion. In goodness. So, all three are wrong actions for this
world. Because the soul by nature is spiritual. And being spiritual, the soul's
natural actions are to love and serve Krishna. But if the soul does not know
anything about spiritual knowledge, the soul is not connected with Krishna, then
the only options that are there for the soul are the options that are provided
by material nature. And all these options are based on the platform of
ignorance. The platform of forgetfulness of Krishna. As a platform of ignorance
of one's spiritual identity. So, there is variety. But how this world wants to
act? Goodness. Passions. Ignorance. But ultimately, there is no real variety.
Because the soul just does not know about God. You know, now, that is actually
the predicament for the souls in the non-human species. They just have to act
the way material nature wishes them to act. And in, you know, human body, a...,
a..., also, the material nature keeps pushing us to act in particular ways. We
cannot entirely resist or reject the pulls and pushes of material nature. We
have to act in responsible ways. That means we unl..., if we do not resi..., we,
if we do not strongly fight against the pushes of material nature, we will be
impelled to act in particular ways. So, that means, a ksatriya will be impelled
to fight. A ksatriya will be impelled to manage to the na..., to the manage, to
administer. That is the nature. And the nature cannot be given up. A vaisya will
be money-minded. A vaisya will have a particular inclination by which the vaisya
will think about, ok, this, this, this, this. That is all. That is how the mind
will be. And that is how the actions will turn out to be. So, here, the point
which Krishna is making to Arjuna through the context of this verse is that you
cannot entirely resist or reject your material nature. But act according to your
nature. But within the previ..., within the, a, limits of dharma. So, a vasya is
money-minded. But then the vaisya is told, yes, earn money, but by dharmic
means. A ksatriya, in the 18th chapter, we will see, has a quality called as
"īśvara-bhāvaś". Now, "īśvara-bhāvaś" is, you know, the, now, literally
speaking, if we translate, the mood of God. That is what "īśvara-bhāvaś" would
mean. "bhāvaḥ" is mood or emotion. "īśvara" is controller. The ultimate
controller is Krishna. So, "īśvara-bhāvaś". And Krishna talks about this
quality, not in a negative sense, but in a positive sense. What do we mean by
positive sense? Krishna talks about the quality in a, in the sense that it is a
desirable quality. "īśvara-bhāvaś" is a laudable quality in ksatriyas. So, he
says, you know, i..., dāna..., n..., "yuddhe cāpy apalāyanam". So, just as in
the same breath that He talks about, other good qualities, "yuddhe cāpy
apalāyanam", for example, you know, the ks..., ksa..., ksatriyas never flee from
a battle. "yu...", "pa...", "apa...", "palāyanam" means to fly out, to run away.
"apalāyanam" means to not, never run away. And "yuddhe". In a battlefield, even
if they are faced against very difficult lords, ksatriyas will not run away. So,
this is a quality that indicates the heroism of ksatriyas, the courage of
ksatriyas. So, in that same list of qualities, He talks about "īśvara-bhāvaś",
also. So, "īśvara-bhāvaś" is not a negative quality in a ksatriya. It is just a
fact of nature. The ksatriya will have that nature. You know, ksatriya will have
an inclination to delegate, to organise, to manage, to administer. So, rather
than trying to reject, you know, resist or suppress that nature, one, the, it
is, one is encouraged to, you dovetail that nature in Krishna's service. So, if
we see, the previous verse was talking "joṣayet sarva-karmāṇi". "joṣayet" means
to dovetail. So, Krishna is continuing that theme over here. And the essential
message that He is giving through this verse is that if you think that you are
the fighter of ksatriya, as a ksatriya, or you are the renounc..., renouncer as
a jnana-yogi. In both cases, actually, you have to understand that you are
impelled by your mind. And your mind is making you act in particular ways. So,
rather than entirely trying to reject the mind, try to get the mind's pushings
within the prec..., within the limits of dharma. And dovetail yourself in
devotional service.

So, the point which Krishna is making to Arjuna is that, you know, if you are
thinking right now, I will renounce the world. And I will go to the forest. It
is simply the modes impelling you to do this. But this impell..., you know, this
impulse of the mode, is not in pin..., harmony with your nature. And because it
is not in harmony with your normal nature, there will be disruption. So,
understand what is your nature and act accordingly. Why act accordingly? Not
just we s..., completely surrender to our nature. But rather, we dovetail our
nature in devotional service. When we dovetail our nature in devotional service,
you know, or at least within the precincts of dharma. Devotional service is
bhakti-yoga. You know, will, now, bhakti-yoga might be karma-yoga, also. Which
is what Arjuna is talking about over here. But even by that, you will become
purified gradually. So, the emphasis of this verse is recognise that your body
has certain inclinations. Your mind has certain inclinations. You cannot resist
or reject them, you know, completely. So, therefore, dovetail them. That is the,
that is what we will see from the next verse. So:

        tattva-vit tu mahā-bāho
        guṇa-karma-vibhāgayoḥ
        guṇā guṇeṣu vartanta
        iti matvā na sajjate

"tattva-vit tu mahā-bāho". "tattva-vit" is one who is a knower. "tattva-vit".
So, Krishna has used the word "tattva-darśibhiḥ" in, earlier in 2.16.

        nāsato vidyate bhāvo
        nābhāvo vidyate sataḥ
        ubhayor api dṛṣṭo ’ntas
        tv anayos tattva-darśibhiḥ

"tattva-darśibhiḥ". So, similar, "tattva-darśibhiḥ" is seer of truth. Here,
"tattva-vit" is knower of truth. "tattva-vit tu mahā-bāho". Oh, Arjuna, Oh,
mighty-armed one. "guṇa-karma-vibhāgayoḥ". "guṇa-karma-vibhāgayoḥ". That the
difference between work and devo..., Prabhupada translates that.
"guṇa-karma-vibhāgayoḥ". Prabhupada translates that as work in devotion and work
for fruitive results. "guṇā guṇeṣu vartanta". So, that person understands that,
actually, one, I am acting. Essentially, what is happening? "guṇā guṇeṣu
vartanta". The modes are acting in relationship with each other.

        guṇā guṇeṣu vartanta
        iti matvā na sajjate

Knowing this, such a person does not become attached. "na sajjate". So, here,
what is Krishna saying? That "tattva-vit". That person who is the knower of the
Absolute Truth. Such a person understand that when I am acting, when, as a
ksa..., brahmana. I am studying. I am teaching shastra. I might become proud. I
know so much knowledge. I know far more than other people. And see how nicely I
give classes. So, if I become like that, I am misidentifying with my
psychophysical nature. And that sort of mentality will cause me bondage. But if
I understand "guṇā guṇeṣu vartanta". "guṇā guṇeṣu vartanta". That means that, 
actually, the modes are, the senses are en..., senses and the modes are
interacting with each other, each other. And basically, in the material field,
action is being performed according to my nature. So, then, I will not become
bound. Because I will understand that, ok, this is my nature. This is how I
should be acting. "guṇā guṇeṣu vartanta". So, in this way, we will be able act
and move forward in our life if we take things systematically. "guṇā guṇeṣu".
So, how do we do "guṇā guṇeṣu vartanta"? You know, this does not, Krishna
is not telling over here, because the modes are acting, therefore you should
now..., what should you do? Immediate that you surrender to the modes. Not
that you completely try to resist the modes. These are not possible. But what
the "tattva-vit tu"? "tattva-vit" does. "tattva-vit tu" is that, actually, if I
do not get attached, then I will not become bound. You know, "iti matvā na
sajjate". "na sajjate" means, the person says that I, oh, I will not become
bound by this. So, all this may seem a little bit abstract and philosophical for
us. Because to familiarise ourselves with the concept of the three modes itself
takes some time. But essentially, what this means is that a conditioned soul,
c..., when the conditioned soul becomes a sadhaka and starts practicing
spiritual life, at that time, the soul understands that I am a..., I am trapped
in a machine. This body is basically like a machine. And as a machine, it has
certain pushings, certain pullings, by default. Just like in a computer,
sometimes, when we choose certain options, they become default options. When
they become default options by, as soon as we turn on the machine, those
settings get activated. And the default option turns on. So, like that, based on
the way we have acted in the past, the body ha..., and the mind, both of them,
have developed certain tendencies. So, although the computer's default settings
can be changed. But default setting getting activated happens automatically. And
changing of the default settings does not happen automatically. That requires
conscious involvement and effort. Similarly, the body has certain default
settings. And those t..., according those default settings, the soul acts. So,
when the soul acts, what does it mean soul acts according to those default
settings? The soul is transcendental. But when the soul is within the body. And
the soul is acting in the material realm, the soul will act according to the
default settings of the body. So, when the soul acts according to default
settings of the body, at that time, you know, the soul actually moves, step by
step, forward in spiritual life. That means, you know, by acting our default
settings, but keeping that within the limit of dharma.

So, you know, I am a, I have the nature of a shudra. Rather than resenting it.
And trying to imagine, oh, I would like to be a brahmana. No, if I am a shudra,
no problem. It is not that shudras are outlaws. It is not that shudras cannot
practice, our, now, cannot practice dharma. They have their dharma. By
practicing the dharma, you know, of a shudra, one will become elevated. So,
here, Krishna is saying that recognise that the modes are the actua..., the
doers. And, you know do not let the modes ca..., g..., take you on a ride which
is outside the, which takes you outside the precincts of dharma. At the same
time, do not completely resist the modes, also. Neither is possible. Regulate
it. Here, Bhagavad Gita offers us a middle way. "iti matvā na sajjate". Now,
Prabhupada's purports focuses on the point of "tattva-vit". Who is a
"tattva-vit"? Prabhupada quo..., go..., correlates this with the Sri..., Srimad
Bhagavatam verse:

        vadanti tat tattva-vidas
        tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam
        brahmeti paramātmeti
        bhagavān iti śabdyate

"vadanti tat tattva-vidas". So, "tattva-vit" was there over here. And
"tattva-vidas" was over there. Same point, verse, almost. So, now, Krishna will
continue the same point and He will explain this further.

        prakṛter guṇa-sammūḍhāḥ
        sajjante guṇa-karmasu
        tān akṛtsna-vido mandān
        kṛtsna-vin na vicālayet

"prakṛter guṇa-sammūḍhāḥ". "guṇa-sammūḍhāḥ" means. "sammūḍhāḥ". "mūḍhāḥ" is
deluded. "sammūḍhāḥ" is completely deluded. "samyak rupena mudha". It is
completely deluded. So, you know, f..., earlier, Krishna has said "vimūḍhātmā".
Krishna is continuing the same theme, you know, thread of thought over here.
Let us take some "mūḍhāḥ". So, one who is deluded by "prakṛter guṇa". By the
three modes of material nature. You know. "sajjante guṇa-karmasu". Such a person
becomes attached to the "guṇa-karma". So, here, say, we have to remember that
the word "guṇa", here, does not refer to qualities. It refers to modes. If you
see, "guṇa-karma" has qualities and activities. We will get confused. It does
not make s..., much sense over here. "guṇa-karma" here means activities which
are within the prec..., within the, you know, influence of the thr..., which
are im..., impelled. Which are motivated. Which are actuated by the three modes.
So, "tān akṛtsna-vido mandān". So, you know, gu..., who does like this? Who
becomes attached? "akṛtsna-vido". One who does not know properly. A..., and
"mandān". "mandān" means lazy. Hmm. "kṛtsna-vin na vicālayet". "na vicālayet"
means does not disturb. So, here, it is another point which Prabhu..., another
second time, Prabhupada is repeating. Or rather, Krishna is repeating what He
has talked about earlier. "na buddhi-bhedaṁ janayed". He had said at the start
of this section. So, now, He is again repeating "na vicālayet". "na vicālayet"
means do not disturb. So, why do not disturb? Because by such disturbance, one
goes under a, one disrupts people's gradual advancement. See, the Vedic
scriptures give two methods for advancement. One is the gradual method. And the
other is the rapid method. So, the gradual method involves dovetailing people's
propensities for the sake of slow progression. So, karma-kanda involves what?
People, people want material enjoyment. So, they are given material enjoyment.
How? Through the means of, you know, dharma, artha, kama, and moksha. So, people
go through dharma, and artha, artha kama. And that itself, the cycle may go on
for many lifetimes. And after that, they will gradually seek moksha. So, this
is a gradual way for elevation. Now, the important point is dharma, artha, kama
is that social order is maintained while people are also provided sense
gratification. How can it, people provided sense gratification? Because there is
arrangement for artha and kama. People, you know, for most people, material
pleasure is a necessity. And for devotees, also, only when we are very
spiritually advanced can we r..., survive only on spiritual happiness. So, and
then, in the sadhaka stage, you know, we have sweet, we have nice music. We have
nice prasad. We have loving devotee association. And are we getting material
pleasure? Or are we getting spiritual pleasure over here? You know, actually, it
should be spiritual happiness. But it not, is not always spiritual happiness.
When kirtans are going on. Are we relishing spiritual happiness at that time?
You know, if it were purely spiritual, then we could have just the same tune
being sung every day month after month, year after year. And we would not need
to, say, change tunes. But still, we c..., differentiate. Oh, this devotee sings
nicely. This devotee does not sing so nicely. When there is prasad, see, oh,
what is there for prasad today? Oh, I decide. Not decide. If we were actually
tasting Krishna through the prasad, then whatever be the prasad, we would be
s..., we would be having the same level of enthusiasm. You know. But we do not.

We have, so, this is not necessarily bad. There is variety in the spiritual
realm, also. And it is not that to prove that I am devoted to prasad, I have to
take the same food every day. You know. I have transcended the faculty of taste.
That is not the mood of bhakti. We do not want just to transcend. We want to
spiritualise. So, the point which we, we ma..., made is that, you know, right
now, in the sadhaka stage, we want to give up all material happiness. But
because we are living at the material level of consciousness, at the material
level of reality, right now. So, therefore, you know, the spiritual happiness
becomes manifest to us through material means. So, when, you know, in the, when
we hear kirtans. Or we see, participate in, you know, feasts. So, at that time,
the material aspects also play a role in our being attracted or not being
attracted. This is not necessarily bad. This is just a, a, arrangement by which
we can gradually be elevated. Slowly, steadily and ultimately, we come to the
spiritual level, where the material level just does not matter for us. But for
most sadhakas, you know, for most people, who are not necessarily sadhakas, or
spiritual rea..., truth, they are basically, you know, dharmic people. They are
a, religious people. And they want to stay within the precincts of dharma. Now,
when I say dharma, it is like a big circle. Within dharma, there is apara
dharma. And then, there is para dharma. So, within the circle of dharma, dharma,
artha, kama, moksha also comes. And in this, as this circle of dharma becomes
s..., c..., s..., smaller and smaller. It takes us closer and closer to the
ultimate goal that is Krishna. So, in the system of dharma, artha, kama, moksha,
Krishna may not be the goal of people. Their goal is artha and kama, primarily.
Although they acknowledge Krishna. And they want to also worship Krishna. But
they do not want to purely devote themselves to Krishna. But when people come
to:

        dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo ’tra paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ

The Bhagavatam talks about "param dha...", "para dharmaḥ". And there, at the,
the, at that place, dharma, artha, kama, mosha is pushed aside. So, at that
level of reality, you know, the focus becomes not dharma, artha, you know, kama.
But it becomes, you know, prema. It becomes love of Krishna. So, that is the
level where people are ready to settle, you know, fi..., become fixed on, you
know, the ultimate truth. So, now, what Krishna is saying over here is that do
not try to rush people to the higher level of renunciation. So, there is dharma,
artha, kama. And there is moksha. So, when people are not ready for moksha. If
we, if we push them to moksha prematurely, that will create problems for them.
They will not be able to prac..., they will not be able to do that. So,
"kṛtsna-vin na vicālayet". Krishna says, do not disturb these people. What will
happen? Earlier, in this chapter, He has talked about "mithyācāraḥ sa ucyate". A
person is, you know, pushed to renounce the world. And when the person renounces
the world, you know, does not have to capacity to renounce the world. And the
person becomes hypocritic, at that time. That is undesirable. Now, w..., we, we
again, this chapter may raise this issue again and again that we also have, you
know, you know, devotees in the renounced order. So, in the early days of our
movement, it was thought as if that, if you want to be a serious devotee, you
have to be renunciate. And if somebody does not renunciate, that means that
person is not a serious devotee. But this is a  misconception. You know. You
know. One's seriousness is not determined by one's ashram. One's seriousness is
determined by, by one's comm..., conviction, one's commitment. And that is what
is important. At the end of the, you know, our life, Krishna is not going to see
which ashram we lived in. Krishna will see how much ashrai we had taken. You
know, how mu..., not which a..., both the a..., whichever ashram we are in, the
ashram is a facility by which we can take ashraya of Krishna. So, whichever
ashram we stay in, what is important is how much ashraya of Krishna we take. So,
if somebody is in the renounced order, that person becomes proud. See, I am a
renunciate, and does not take ashraya of Krishna, then that will not make much
further spiritual advancement. If somebody is in the grihasta ashram, and does not
take ashraya of Krishna, thinks that, you know, see. I am such an influential
person in the world. I am giving charity to the temple. It is because of me that
all the renunciates are being maintained. One starts becoming proud like that.
Then, one is not taking ashraya of Krishna. One, there, also, will not make
spiritual advancement. So, this, our spiritual advancement is not determined by
where we are situated. You know. It is determined by how we are situated. How
means, how we, our consciousness is situated. So, here, Krishna is telling
that different people have different natures. So, where, depending on their
convictions, depending on their, you know, level, right now, they have to be
situated accordingly. If we try to push them first, it will not work. So, again,
we have to remember with respect to Krishna Conscious situation, Krishna is not
talking here about bhakti-yoga at all. He is talking about a comparison between
karma-yoga and jnana-yoga. So, essentially, He is telling that people who are
not qualified to give up their karma. That means, you know, there are three
levels. There is karma-yoga. There is karma-kanda. And there is jnana-yoga. So,
Krishna is telling here, you know, now, He is repeatedly, His point is do not
give up. Do..., do not go for jnana-yoga. Why? Although even if jnana-yoga is
higher, people are not capable of doing it. So, do not do it. And do not
instruct people to do it. Let them act according to that level.

So, now, let them act in the world. How should they act? Krishna is telling,
Arjuna, you act in karma-yoga. People may be acting early in karma-kanda. But
you act in karma-yoga. For what purpose? By this, you will become elevated. By
this, gradually, you will become, you know, because you set a good example, you
will, you know, beha..., contributing in the social order. And also, because you
are acting with detachment, you will become elevated. So, let us look at this
verse again. "prakṛter guṇa-sammūḍhāḥ". So, one who is deluded by the modes of
material nature.

        prakṛter guṇa-sammūḍhāḥ
        sajjante guṇa-karmasu

So, say, detached people, how do they act? When they act, they become attached.
The "guṇa", when they do "gu...", "guṇa-karma", they become attached. Previous
verse was, says "na sajjate". Do not become attached. But here, it says, they
will become attached. But even if they are becoming attached, "na vicālayet". Do
not disturb them. Because through that attachment, gradually, they will develop
realisation. They will develop detachment. But if they are, do not do,
prematurely renounce. They will disrupt their conscious..., they will disrupt
their spiritual life, entirely. They will disrupt society, also. "kṛtsna-vin na
vicālayet". So, Prabhupada writes that:

"Such bewildered persons may be engaged in such primary moral principles of life
as nonviolence and similar materially benevolent work."

Now, here, Prabhupada makes a very significant statement that Kr...:

"Lord Kṛṣṇa advises us not to disturb them and simply waste valuable time. But
the devotees of the Lord are more kind than the Lord because they understand the
purpose of the Lord. Consequently they undertake all kinds of risks, even to the
point of approaching ignorant men to try to engage them in the acts of Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, which are absolutely necessary for the human being."

So, here, you know, Krishna, Pra..., a, Prabhupada is saying as if the devotees
are contradicting Krishna's will. Actually, they are not contradicting. They are
fulfilling Krishna's will. See, ultimately, within this progression, dharma,
artha, kama, moksha, Krishna ultimately wants all souls to come back to the
spiritual world. And to be with him, and to be forever happy with him. That is
what Krishna ultimately wants. But when He wants this ultimately,
transitionally, there is a progression. You know, the souls cannot suddenly, you
know, suddenly give up things. There is a progressive treatment that is
happening. You know. For example, if a parent has a child in a hospital. So, at
that time, the parents wants the chi..., parent wants the child to come back
home from the hospital. But that does not mean that if the child is in the
middle of a treatment. Which is going to take, as the, as a complex and a,
se..., complex disease, which requires several months of treatment, the, th...,
you know, for a parent cannot feel that, oh, current say that, oh, I want my
child home. So, let him just leave everything and come home. That sort of coming
home will not be of much use. The, first, the child is in the hospital. The
child has to be treated, get cured and then come back home. So, there is a
process of gradual treatment. That is dharma, artha, kama, and moksha. Which
may, takes:

        bahūnāṁ janmanām ante

And there is a rapid treatment which involves a practice of bhakti-yoga. So,
now, bhakti-yoga is what Srila Prabhupada is talking about over here. That the
devotees think that even if people get a little disturbed. Let them practice
spiritual life. Let them take the fast track treatment. So, imagine that there
is a hospital where there is a slow course of treatment. And there is a fast
course of treatment. Now, there are, now, the, naturally, if there are two kinds
of treatments, we may say, everyone want fast course of treatment. But maybe,
the fast course of treatment involves more sacrifices. You know, you have to,
so, practice a very severe diet. And have s..., you know, very strict exercise,
regiment. And involves so much sacrifice that people say I cannot do this. So,
let me take the slow track treatment. I can get cured in one month or I can get
cur..., cured in one year. But I cannot do this higher, hi..., h..., fast track
treatment. So, let me take one, take the one year treatment. So, like that,
there is a slow track treatment. And there is a fast track treatment. So,
dharma, artha, kama, moksha is the slow track. And bhakti is the fast track. So,
Prabhupada says that let a devotee practice the fast, devotees want people to
take up the fast track treatment. That is why the Lord, you know, the Lord's
purpose is fulfilled by the devotees. By devotees going and telling people.
Please do this. Do this. So, now, after this, Krishna says that, ultimately, the
karma-yoga also has to be offered to Him. He is the object of karma-yoga,
ultimately.

        mayi sarvāṇi karmāṇi
        sannyasyādhyātma-cetasā
        nirāśīr nirmamo bhūtvā
        yudhyasva vigata-jvaraḥ

So, "mayi sarvāṇi karmāṇi". Unto Me, all "karmā"s. "sannyasyā". Give up the
fruits of all work to Me. "ādhyātma-cetasā". "ādhyātma-cetasā" means with
spiritual consciousness. "nirāśīr nirmamo bhūtvā". Without any desire and
without any possessiveness. "yudhyasva vigata-jvaraḥ". Fight without lethargy.
So, actually, this is one of the very important verses. And Prabhupada says,
this, this, a..., s..., al..., almost like military discipline, just like a,
mi..., in a military world, there is a point, military discipline means, you
know, military, when a person is suppo..., su..., do not do something, just do
it. You know, however one feels, you know, the, ea..., early in the morning, the
cadets are told to wake up, and go for archery. There, the discipline is so
strict that they are not allowed to disobey. This is what you are told to do,
just do it. Do not ask any questions. Why is that? Because the military is a
very serious service. You know, when the soldiers are on the war field, at that
time, they have to obey the orders. And by obeying the orders itself, they will
be able to, it is a matter of life for death. For them, as well as for their
colleagues. So, they have very strict training. Now, practicing spiritual life
is not just a matter of life for death. It is a matter of eternal life versus
repeated birth and death. It is also a very serious matter. Because it is such a
serious matter, it has to be accorded, you know, the duge amount of gravity in
terms of commitment and training. So, this verse talks about that. So, let us
look at this. So, this verse actually. There are four lines in it. And each of
these lines talks about something which will take one upwards. So,
"vigata-jvaraḥ". "yudhyasva vigata-jvaraḥ". So, "yudhyasva" is like the primary
verb in it. What should I do? Arjuna. Fight. And fight how? "vigata-jvaraḥ".
"vigata-jvaraḥ" means to give up lethargy. So, this is talking about giving up
the mode of ignorance. "nirāśīr nirmamo bhūtvā". So, to have "asā". And to have
"mamata". To have desires. And to have attachments for positions. That is the
mode of passion. So, the L..., a, the deal entry point 30D says, give up
ignorance. 3.30C says, give up passion. "sannyasyādhyātma-cetasā". This refers
to when one, a, when one comes to spiritual consciousness, that co..., that is
actually, coming not just to goodness, but even going beyond goodness. Because
in goodness, one still has attachment to worldly things. So, "sannyasya" and
"ādhyātma-cetasā", they are actually at the peak of goodness. And "mayi sarvāṇi
karmāṇi" is transcendental. So, a, it is not just, you know, a devotional. It is
transcendental. What is the difference between, you know, devotional and
transcendental? Actually, devotional means somebody can be, when, the, thing
will, think, mode of material nature. And su..., at the same time, do devotional
activities. So, all of us have to do devotional activities. But are all of us
transcendental? No. We are not yet transcendental. We are struggling to
transcend. And sometimes, we are pulled down. Sometimes, we are able to rise up.
So, so, that means, see, there is, there is ignorance, passion, goodness. Then,
there is transcendence. And in transcendence, also, actually, there is
spiritual. And there is devotional. In transcendence, there is spiritual and
devotional. What is the difference between spiritual and devotional? Spiritual
would mean, in general, anything to do with the soul. So, even Brahmavada, even
impersonalism can be spiritual. But devotional means that is which is centered
on Krishna. Now, devotional in that sense of perfection is the highest level.
That means, within the spiritual realm, also, if we have, a, you know, there is
spiritual. And there is devotional. So, devotional is the highest. But the
wonderful aspect of devotional is that, devotional f..., can extend from the
highest down to the lowest. So, the devo..., so, path of bhakti is a path that
stretches up to the summit. But then, it goes down to the valley, also, to the
bo..., lowest level. That means that a person in tama-guna can also practice
bhakti-yoga. And, of course, a person if practices bhakti-yoga steadily, will
not stay in tama-guna forever. That person is staying on, in bhakti, in
tama-guna forever, that means the person is not rea..., seriously practicing
bhakti. That person is not letting the potency of bhakti, you know, bring about
an inner transformation. See, that inner transformation has to be brought out,
then the person has to practice bhakti, seriously. And th..., then, the person
will no longer stay in the three modes. So, the point is, bhakti can be
practiced from any mode. So, it is like a big, big ladder. You know, it is a,
you can imagine ladder which extends down, down, down to the lowest level. The
lowest level of goodne..., ignorance. And it is a ladder that goes up, up, up,
and not just to goodness, but beyond goodness, to transcendence. And within
transcendence, also, not just spiritual. But also, pure devotional. So, that is,
that is the process of bhakti-yoga. So, Krishna is saying, "mayi sarvāṇi
karmāṇi". Offer all your work to me. So, this is the first time again, Krishna
has talked about a, offering something to himself. In 2.61, He had said, offer
you..., control your senses. And offer the controlled senses to me.

        tāni sarvāṇi saṁyamya
        yukta āsīta mat-paraḥ

So, here, He is saying, m...:

        mayi sarvāṇi karmāṇi
        sannyasyādhyātma-cetasā

There, it was, you know, control the senses. And fix the mind on me. Here, it
was, it is, with, without lethargy. With detach..., without detachments, without
desires. With renounced consciousness. Without renou..., with renounced
spiritual consciousness. Do your work. "yudhyasva". Fight. And offer the fruits
of your work to me. So, this is, Prabhupada's purport is a classic purport here.
Let us look at it.

"This verse clearly indicates the purpose of the Bhagavad-gītā."

Very significant, the purpose of the Bhagavad Gita is indicated in this verse.
What is that purpose? It is to offer everything to Krishna. So, Prabhupada uses
the word, "as if in military discipline" here. Now, here, Prabhupada also makes
an interesting point.

"The living entity cannot be happy independent of the cooperation of the Supreme
Lord, because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to
become subordinate to the desires of the Lord."

So, it is our nature to be connected with Krishna. To love Krishna. And to gain
happiness thereof. Just as a fish cannot be outsi..., happy outside water, we
cannot be happy separated from Krishna. You know, just as a living being cannot
say, the Padya only has a beautiful verse which says that "My dear Lord, just as
the land, without water, turns to desert. Just as a living being cannot live
without foo..., food. So, that person, sick person needs medicine. Just as a
person with third, desert w..., needs water. Just as a person in a famine needs
food. Just as the flowers need sunlight for blossoming.". So, it gives various
examples from nature. And finally, it says that similarly, oh, Lord, I need you.
So, the point of this verse is that, actually, you, we need you, my dear Lord.
Please reveal yourself to us. Please reveal yourself to us. So, that is our, an
ul..., that is our nature. We cannot live without Krishna. Now, Prabhupada says
that:

"if there is any reluctance to execute such a stern order, which is without
consideration of so-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance
should be thrown off; in this way one may become vigata-jvara, or without
feverish mentality or lethargy."

So, the word "jvaraḥ" has one more meaning. 41:13
