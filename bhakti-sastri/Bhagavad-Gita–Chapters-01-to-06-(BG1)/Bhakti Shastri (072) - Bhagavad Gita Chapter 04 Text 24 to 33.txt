Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhakti Shastri, Bhagavad Gita course. We are
not discussing the Fourth Chapter. We will now discuss about "yajñāyācarataḥ".
In 4.23, we discussed, you know, about Krishna telling Arjuna to act in the mood
of "yajñā". Now, generally, people think of "yajñā" as fire sacrifice. So, we
discussed in 3.9 that "yajñā" is not just an, you know, activity. It is also a
principle. The principle is of sacrifice. The one specific form where, sacrifice
may be through fire. Through the, you know, is Agni Deva who is manifesting as
the fire. Who accepts the offerings that we make. But the essential point is
sacrifice. And actually even the word sacrifice is related in, in English
etymology to the, to sacralise. To sacred. So, sac..., when we sacrifice
something, it is the idea that we are doing something sacred. We are making it
sacred. So, th..., originally the idea of the word sacrifice was related with
the word, you know, sacred. So, Krishna will first give us a very broad vision
of what sacrifice means. And then, He will give specific ways in which Arjuna
can perform sacrifices. So, let us look at the verse. 4.24.

        brahmārpaṇaṁ brahma havir
        brahmāgnau brahmaṇā hutam
        brahmaiva tena gantavyaṁ
        brahma-karma-samādhinā

So, the word "brahma" comes so many times over here. That it might lead to some
confusion. N..., now, the word "brahma", if you see, it comes six times. Two
times in A and B of 4.24 and once in C and D. So, what is Krishna telling over
here? Actually, if we look at the other perjure. "āgnau". "havir". "hutam".
"arpaṇam". So, what these are referring to the components of a sacrifice. So,
"arpaṇam" is that which is offered. M..., the of contribution. "brahmārpaṇaṁ".
So, "arpit karma". To contribute. To give. "brahmārpaṇaṁ". So, what is being
contributed is brahman. "brahma havir". So, "havir" is butter. So, butter is
like the, you know, you know, the fuel in a sense that is used to make sure the
sacrifice grows. So, butter itself can also be called a sacrifice. But along
with that, there are grains and other things, which are sacrifices. Butter is
like the main thing that is added to the fire. So, in that sense, it is separate
over here. "brahma havir". And then, "brahma", "agnau". The fire itself.
"āgnau". That is also brahma. That is also spirit. So, now, brahma here does not
necessarily refer to brahmajyoti. Brahma is used, a generic word used to refer
to spiritual. That is also spiritual. "brahmaṇā hutam". So, "hutam" is the
offered. So, the per..., the o..., person doing the offering, you know, brahma.
So:

        brahmārpaṇaṁ brahma havir
        brahmāgnau brahmaṇā hutam

You know, so, the person doing offering is also spiritual. And then, "brahmaiva
tena gantavyaṁ". "gantavyaṁ" is destination. So, the destination that is
attained is also brahma. And that person, what is the person doing? Krishna was
talking in the previous verses about how one should do karma. So, He is saying,
this person is doing "brahma-karma". That person is doing spiritual work. And
the person is in "samādhinā" is absorbed in "samādhi". So, what is this verse
telling? That when one acts in the spirit of "yajñā". Then, all of existence
becomes like a sacrifice. Once one understands that ultimately, it is, you know,
Krishna's energy that is present everywhere. And that that Krishna's energy is
all-encompassing. Krishna's energy is there for everyone to use for whatever
purposes they want. But it is ultimately Krishna's energy. They can use it for
Krishna's service. They can use it for sense gratification. Whatever they use it
for, it is ultimately Krishna's energy. So, when once we understand this. Then,
you know, and we s..., decide to use it for Krishna's service. We decide to use
it for spiritual purposes in general. Then, everything can become, you know,
spiritually vis..., understood. So, let us look at this specific example to
understand what we mean by spiritually understood. So, we were, discussed this
earlier briefly. Things that are material and spiritual. We can talk about them
in two ways. In a compositional sense. And in an applicational sense.
Compositional means what is material and what is spiritual, it depends on what
it is made of. So, you know, something is made up of sat-cit-ananda, that is
spiritual. Something is made of jala tattva. Like earth, water, fire, air,
ether. Then, that is material. That is from the compositional point of what it
is made up of. But there is also an applicational sense. What is it used for?
So, prasad may be made of material elements. But because it is used for
Krishna's service. So, it is spiritual. So, you know, spiritual means, it is
used for spiritual purposes. So, things can be spiritualised by being used for
spiritual purposes. So, that is the applicational sense of the word spiritual.
So, when we say, the spiritual master's body is spiritual. What does it mean?
That means it is used for spiritual purposes. The spiritual master's body, you
know, may also grow old. It may also get diseases. But that does not
necessarily, that does not make it, you know, you know, you know, materialistic
in the way the mate..., ordinary people's ma..., body is materialistic. Because
the peo..., spiritual master's body is basically used for Krishna's service. So,
because it is being used for Krishna's service, so it leads to spiritual, you
know, you know, it is spiritualised for all practices. Prabhupada says, there
can be a golden box. And there is a gold-plated box. So, you know, that which
sat-cit-ananda is like the golden box. So, that which is spiritualised is like
gold-plated. But essentially, both are actually gold. So, like that, the
spiritual master's, you know, you know, you know, body or other things like
that, which can be spiritualised by the practice of, by culti..., by the
cultivation, by the practice of Krishna Consciousness, of engagement in
devotional service. So, now, let us look at the, what the verse means. So,
Krishna is, is Chakra..., so, Chakravarti Pada, our acharya explained over here.

That re-envision the battlefield as "yajñā". So, here, Arjuna is telling, K...,
a, Krishna, ok, if you want, perform "yajñā". So, Arjuna may get a question
here. That Krishna, if you want me to perform "yajñā". "yajñāyācarataḥ karma".
Then, you know, why am I here on battlefield? This is not a "yajñā". Let me go
to the forest. And there, we will do "yajñā", nicely. You know, we will call
some s..., priests. And we will all do "yajñā" properly. I will, I will do, you
know, I will, I will do "yajñā". I will become a yajamana for doing "yajñā". He
says, now, He says no. Krishna is, you know, acharayas are saying that Krishna
is implying this itself is a "yajñā". So, what is the "yajñā" over here? The
battlefield is your yajna-sthali. And yajna-sthali is the place where "yajñā" is
performed. Then, you have to perform. You have to have a ladle or a spoon for
making the offerings. So, we take things in a spoon. And offer it. So, that
ladle or spoon is the, your Gāṇḍīva bow. And ahuti, who, what is the ahuti that
is to be offered? We offer ghee, or some of the items. So, this ahuti is rais...,
offered to the Kauravas. And who is going to a..., accept the offering? What is
the sacrifical fire? That is the virata-rupa. So, we will discuss in the
Eleventh Chapter how the offering that is being made. Or the virata-rupa will be
devouring everything. So, the warriors, the, so:

        daṁṣṭrā-karālāni ca te mukhāni

You know, "niṣṭrā". So, some:

        daṁṣṭrā-karālāni ca te mukhāni

Your mouth is filled with fearsome teeth. And:

        cūrṇitair uttamāṅgaiḥ

They are entering. And then, they are getting, a, shattered. All the warriors.

        dhṛtarāṣṭran

So, all the sons of Dhṛ..., Dhṛtarāṣṭra. So, the point is, the s..., uni...,
virata-rupa, when it is devouring, it is actually showing how the offering that
is being made is being accepted. So, Krishna is telling Arjuna, "yajñā" is not
just one specific, you know, religious activity. It is the principle. So, if you
are acting for, in the principle of sacrifice, and for the pleasure of the
Absolute Truth. Then, even a battlefield can be a "yajñā". So, this verse
basically says, whatever we are doing, that can become a "yajñā". So, right now,
we are discussing Krishna Katha. So:

        brahmārpaṇaṁ brahma havir
        brahmāgnau brahmaṇā hutam

So, actually, the sound vibration, all of us are doing sacrifice. What is the
sacrifice that we are doing? We are offering our conciousness. So, Krishna is
manifesting as a sound. And we are offering our consciousness to Krishna. You
know, by speaking and hearing. And as we do like this, we speak. And hear. And
offer our consciousness to Krishna. "brahmārpaṇaṁ brahma havir". So, everything
becomes spiritualised over there. And when we become spiritualised, then
"brahmaiva tena gantavyaṁ". We experience advancement. Ultimately, we attain
brahman. We attain the spiritual platform by hearing sound vibration regularly.
"brahma-karma-samādhinā". So, we, because we were actually doing "brahma-karma".
We are doing spiritual activity. So, here, Krishna is telling that let us fix
our mind on, you know, the spirituali..., the spiritual element that underlies
everything. And by use..., com..., spiritualising our consciousness, we can
actually, you know, re-envision everything. Re-envision is not just a, a f...,
sen..., sentimental fantasy or intellectual conceptualisation. It is actually an
insight into the true nature of things. That is what we will get by such
thinking. By such, by the vision that Gita is providing us. Srila Prabhupada's
purport is quite significant. Let us look at some points in, m..., so,
Prabhupada e..., he say that, the Lo..., now, Prabhupada explains the word, oh,
"brahman", how everything is ultimately brahman.

"The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called
brahma-jyotir, His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in
that brahma-jyotir, but when the jyotir is covered by illusion (māyā) or sense
gratiﬁcation, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once
by Kṛṣṇa consciousness;"

So, Pra..., now, he says, so, then, he says that, when the jyotir is covered by
illusion or sense gratiﬁcation, it is called material. What does that mean?
Ultimately, Prabhupada is talking it from the applicational point of view. It,
e..., everything coming from Krishna, we can say, in one sense is spiritual.
Because it is coming from Krishna. But when it is covered by illusion, we think
that it is meant for not s..., Kr..., Kr..., not Kr..., Krishna's service. We
think that it is meant for sense gratification. And when we think that it is
meant for sense gratification, then we become entangled. So, if we want to avoid
such entanglement, then we have to develop the right vision. So, Prabhupada
explains that everything becomes spiritualised when it has the right
consciousness. So, now, let us, now, Krishna will describe different kinds of
"yajñā"s. So, let us look at what these kinds of "yajñā"s are. So, here, there
is literal sac...., sacrifice. Which is nishkama-karma-yoga. Then, there is
worship of devatas. sa-kama-karma-yoga. This is 4.25A and B. Then, offering atma
to brahman. That is jnana-yoga. That is 4.25C, D. So, we will come back to the
list as we move forward. Let us look at the elements one by one. Literal
sacrifice means or nishkama-karma-yoga means actually, the nishkama-karma-yogis,
when they are living in the world, they also perform sacrifice. They also do
"yajñā"s. So, let us look at this 4.25 now:

        daivam evāpare yajñaṁ
        yoginaḥ paryupāsate
        brahmāgnāv apare yajñaṁ
        yajñenaivopajuhvati

So, "daivam evāpare yajñaṁ". So, "daivam" means unto the devatas. "āpare" is
some people. "yajñaṁ". Some people, you know, they perform the "yajñā". "yoginaḥ
paryupāsate". And even those are yogis. Those are worshipping, you know, the
devatas. They are also, at one level, connected with Krishna. They may not be
connected with Krishna at a very high level. They may not connected with S...,
Absolute Truth at a high level. But they are acknowledging there is some higher
reality. So, they are connected. "yoginaḥ paryupāsate". And then, "brahmāgnāv
apare yajñaṁ". So, "apare yajñaṁ" means there are others who perform "yajñā" of
"brahmā", "yajñenaivopajuhvati". "upajuhvati". So, the, what do they offer? They
offer, in one sense, themselves. They offer the soul into the brahman. So, what
does this mean offering themselves into "upajuhvati". That means they
conceptualise that the Brahman is the Absolute Truth. And I, I have to merge
into it. That is also kind of sacrifice. They want to offer themselves. So, the
point is there are different kinds of sacrifices. So, here, Krishna is giving a
vision of how various religious activities which people may perform within the,
you know, broad Vedic culture, they are all various forms of "yajñā". Now, of
course, after describing these various forms of "yajñā". Krishna will describe
their purpose. And then, He will recommend to Arjuna what you should do. You
know, the point is, Krishna is describing here different kinds of "yajñā". So,
you know, hmm, Prabhupada t..., talks about here "bahv-īśvara-vādī".

"Those who are interested in material beneﬁts worship the demigods by various
sacriﬁces according to the Vedic rituals. They are called bahv-īśvara-vādī, or
believers in many gods."

So, how can somebody be a "bahv-īśvara-vādī"? Now, "polytheism" is the idea that
there are many gods. Theism is belief in God. Monotheism is belief in one God.
Polytheism is belief in many gods. Pantheism is the belief that there are,
there, everything is God. So, henotheism is the belief that there is one
Absolute Truth which manifests in many forms. So, you know, actually, there are
many versions of this. So, here, the "bahv-īśvara-vādī" are the polytheists. You
know, so, polytheism always faces a l..., sim..., m..., fun..., f..., an
unsolvable logical problem how can someone believe in a, m..., there being many
supremes? You know, if we say God. The word God generally connotes supreme. How
can there be one supreme? So, then, the possibility is that, ok, there are
multiple possibilities. There are different departments. And there are different
gods in charge of different departments. And is there one supreme beyond that?
That is the Vedic understanding. These are like the departments. And they are
the cabinet ministers in the universal government. And above that, there is a
Supreme God. So, this is the correct understanding. There are many gods. But
they are all assistants of the one Supreme God. So, is the Vedic philosophy
polytheistic or many..., monotheistic? It is actually monotheistic. But it is,
it is multilevel monotheism. That there are many gods. In the Christian
tradition, in the Islamic tradition, in the Abrahamic traditions, generally,
their idea was the true God. And false gods. That means they have the idea that
false god means these are gods which do not exist, only. They have been created
by the imagination of people. So, that is why they have the idea that, you know,
ok, wherever they will conquer some territory. If we look at the history of
these religions. They will destroy the forms of worship over there. And they say
that, the false god has to be rejected. So that the true God can be established.
Vedic understanding is not that way. The what, they do not consider as false
gods. They are subordinate gods. And there is one supreme God. And the
subordinate gods are assistants of the Supreme God. So, it is multilevel
monotheism. Now, you know, here, Krishna is talking about how different people,
peop..., perform different "yajñā"s. Now, after describing this
"bahv-īśvara-vādī" and the "brahma-vādī", Krishna moves forward and discuss
another kind of "yajñā".

        śrotrādīnīndriyāṇy anye
        saṁyamāgniṣu juhvati
        śabdādīn viṣayān anya
        indriyāgniṣu juhvati

So, "śrotrādīnīndriyāṇy anye". "anye" is some other people. Previously, the word
was used "apare". Here is "anye". It means the same thing more or less. So,
there are other people who, what is the "yajñā" that they do? "juhvati". They
offer what? "juhvati" means offer. So, they offer, you know, the hearing process
in "saṁyamā". That means, what, are, they do is, they use their ears and turn
them inwards. And offer them to the, a, mind. So, they offer their, the hearing
process in the fire of mental control, of self-restraint. That means that
actually, the ea..., so, essential principle of sacrifice is that, what c...,
could be used for our pleasure, we use it for offering to Krishna for his
pleasure. And then we use a, whatever comes, whatever remains from it for our
pleasure. If the, a, we will get pleasure, higher spiritual, but comes, comes
by connecting with Krishna. So, the ears, we can use it to hear so many things.
We can hear m..., a, movie music. We can hear, a, different kinds of song
vibrations. And they may give us some pleasure. But what we do is, we turn the
ears inwards and offer them in the fire of mental restraint. That means we do
not hear about mundane subjects. You know, so, we he..., we turn and, you know,
when we offer the ears in the hear, in the fire of mental control means we use
the mind to control what all we will hear. We do not expose ourselves to
material sound vibrations. We focus on hearing spiritual sound vibrations. So,
this, so, this is, Prabhupada explains is what the brahmacaris do. The
unadulterated brahmacaris, Prabhupada says. What do they do? They turn their
senses inwards. The eyes can look at beautiful things. But they turn the eyes.
And they turn them inwards. That means, they do not, what were, might give the
eyes pleasure. They do not ge..., ing..., indulge in those activities. They use
the acti..., eyes for spiritual purposes. So, this is one level of "yajñā". When
we take the senses and offer them into the mind. And then, the, Krishna says,
other part is, "śabdādīn viṣayān anya", other people, what do they do is,
"viṣayān". "viṣayān" is sense object. "śab...". And the exa..., gives the
example of "śabdā". "śabdā" is sound vibration. So, that is correlated with what
was earlier talked about. "śrotrā". "śrotrā" is ears. So, "indriyāgniṣu
juhvati". And they offer it into the senses. What does this mean? This means
that, actually, when a person, you know, is a regulated householder. At that
time, there is contact with the senses and sense objects. But that contact is
not unrestrained. That contact is not irreligious. That contact is also based on
the principle of sacrifice. So, when the senses are offered in the sense
objects. Sense objects are offered into the senses. Then, when that is done
within the precincts of dharma, then that is actually a, not irreligious. We
will see in the Seventh Chapter. Krishna will tell.

        dharmāviruddho bhūteṣu
        kāmo ’smi bharatarṣabha

When there is, you know, there is sex life. That is not contrary to religious
principles. Then, that is actually Krishna manifesting Himself. So, these
peop..., the regulated householder performs "yajñā" by offering the senses,
sense objects and senses in a regulated way. That means that there is sacrifice
involved there, also. Modern sacrifice is, afterwise is regulation. Whatever
could be done in an unregulated way, when it is done in a regulated way. That is
sacrifice. And by that, people become purified. So, Prabhupada writes in the
purport that there are four varnas. And, so:

"brahmacārī hears only words concerning Kṛṣṇa consciousness; hearing is the
basic principle for understanding, and therefore the pure brahmacārī engages
fully in harer nāmānukīrtanam – chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. He
restrains himself from the vibrations of material sounds,"

And here, Prabhupada quotes from the Bhagavatam. This is a paraphrase of the
verse.

"Sex life, intoxication and meat-eating are general tendencies of human society,
but a regulated householder does not indulge in unrestricted sex life and other
sense gratiﬁcation."

This way, this is also a kind of "yajñā". Now, Krishna will describe another
kind of "yajñā" here. So:

        sarvāṇīndriya-karmāṇi
        prāṇa-karmāṇi cāpare
        ātma-saṁyama-yogāgnau
        juhvati jñāna-dīpite

So, here, now, Krishna is describing another kind of "yajñā". So, what has it,
what we have seen? We have seen worship of devatas. Then, we have seen the 21:03
