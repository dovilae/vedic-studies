Hare Krishna.

Welcome to the Bhakti Sastri course, where we start with the Isopanisad.

Now that we have completed that Isopanisad, we will start with the Nectar of
Instruction or the Upadesamrita by Srila Rupa Goswami.

So let us recap what we have discussed what we discussed at the start of the
Isopanisad, about the importance of the four books. Essentially, in spiritual
life, we need to know sadhya and sadhana. Sadhya is the goal, that which is to
be achieved. That is ultimately Krishna.

        vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyo

And sadhana is the means, the process by which we are supposed to achieve that.
So if I want to go, I need to know where do I want to go? Ok, I want to go to
Delhi, I want to go to Mayapur. So, if I want to go to Mayapur, then the next
destination is fixed, then the process, am I going by train, or plane, or ship,
whatever.

So that is the sadhya and sadhana. Now, the sadhya and sadhana, they are
established through Bhagavad Gita and Isopanisad. That means how among the
various sadhyas, bhakti is the highest, how among the various sadhanas,
Bhagavan, Krishna is the highest. That is established through Bhagavad Gita and
Isopanisad.

And how they are to be practiced, how, further knowledge, how bhakti is to be
practiced, and who Krishna actually is, as a person, is talked about in the
Nectar of Devotion, Nectar of Instruction.

Now, of course, this division, like any other division, is not water-proof. Even
in the Bhagavad Gita, we do get directions about how to practice bhakti when
Krishna says:

        mac-citta mad-gata-prana

In 10.11, or 10.9 when he says that, or when he says:

        satatam kirtayanto mam

9.14. So there is this description also, but the systematic delineation of
bhakti, the details of how it should be practiced, the way it is given in the
Nectar of Devotion, Nectar of Instruction, it is not given in Bhagavad Gita.
Bhagavad Gita analyses various processes and then establishes the supremacy of
bhakti.

Nectar of Instruction, we will see, it does not talk, mention much about
ashtanga yoga, jnana yoga or karma yoga because that is not its focus. It
assumes that the seeker has accepted the point that bhakti is the best way, and
now, how is bhakti to be practiced.

Now, Nectar of Devotion will compare bhakti a little bit with other processes.
It will glorify the supremacy of bhakti in the beginning, and then immediately
will start off by explaining the details of bhakti, and then describing 64
qualities of Bhagavan also.

So sadhya and sadhana, how they are established through Bhagavad Gita and
Isopanisad. Now, they are established preliminary through Isopanisad. Isopanisad
we saw that, it moved from a universalis understanding of Ishvaras, the
controller of the universe, to a personalist understanding, as a person who has
a ace, and who bestows mercy and removes obstacles, and who can be called to at
the moment of death.

Now, the mood of approach in the Isopanisad, the last four verses, five verses
especially, last four mantras, fifteen to eighteen, they werre focusing on
prayers. That is essentially bhakti. So, the Isopanisad points towards Bhagavan
and bhakti, a personalist understanding and a prayerful attitude towards the
Absolute Truth. This will be elaborated further in the Bhagavad Gita. And we
will go to that gradually. Now we are focusing on the Nectar of Instruction
because it elaborates the process of bhakti, and it enables us to apply those
principles in our day-to-day life.

So, our process will be, first we will establish, then we will look at the
application. So, philosophical understanding through Isopanisad, then practical
applicatiion through Nectar of Instruction. Then again philosophical
understanding through Bhagavad Gita, and then practical appication through
Nectar of Devotion. That is the way we are going to take these four books.

And in the first two books, that means the Bhagavad Gita, so that means the
Isopanisad and the Nectar of Instruction, we will be focusing on the purports of
Srila Prabhupada, analysing them, categorising them, and then based on that, we
will be understanding Srila Prabhupada's mood and mission and how he wanted us
to practice Krishna Consciousness. When we come to Bhagavad Gita, because the
book is so big, we will not be able to go through detailing the purports, and
analysing the purports. We will be focusing more on the flow of the Gita and the
way that flow is understood through Srila Prabhupada's purports as well as the
previous acharyas' purports.

When we look at the Isopanisad, we will discuss a few, so when we look at the
Nectar of Instruction, we will also look at the few points which Bhaktivinoda
Thakur makes in his book Bhaktyaloka occasionally, Bhaktisiddanta Sarasvati
Thakur also wrote a commentary on the Nectar of Instruction, called Anutri
commentary, which Srila Prabhupada quotes quite frequently in his own purports.
We will look at that also, but our primary focus will be on the bhaktivedanta
purports. We discussed this approach at the start of the Isopanisad also. We
want to go systematically, so first we build our philosophical fundamentals by
understanding the mood that Srila Prabhupada wanted and the message that Srila
Prabhupada delivered. So, once we understand that, then we can look at what the
previous acharyas are also saying to supplement our understanding.

In the Nectar of Instruction, the essence is actually the practice of bhakti.
So, let us look at the themes in the Nectar of Instruction. There are various
themes which are all related with practical life. It talks about mind and sense
control, in the pratical, very important in the first three verses. Then it
talks about attitude, how we should have attitude in spiritual life and towards
devotees, and towards the process. Then, Srila Prabhupada also explains how
ISKCON is fulfilling the purpose of providing sadhu sangha. And ISKCON is also
providing, and ISKCON is basically a facility to apply Nectar of Instruction's
many instructions. Then, it talks also about the dynamic relationship between
guru and disciple, and very important aspect of the Nectar of Instruction is the
principle of sadhu sangha, the association of devotees, how we should associate
and how we should not associate with devotees. And when we talk about devotees,
not all devotees are at the same level, so devotees are on a hierarchy, some are
higher, some are lower. So, what are the different kinds of devotees? And how do
we know the kind of devotee that a particular person is? What is the behavior?
What are their qualifications?

And then based on that, 07:04
