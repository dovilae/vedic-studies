Hare Krishna.

Welcome back to the Nectar of Instruction, as a part of our Bhakti Sastri.

Today, we will be discussing one of the most important verses of the Nectar of
Instruction. Now, we are entering deep into the heart of sadhana. Now, we talked
about association in the previous three verses, recognition, texts. And now, we
are moving forward to discuss what do we do in association? So, one of the most
important activities that we do is chant the holy names. And this verse is
fundamental. It is most, single most important verse that can sustain us in the
process of sadhana bhakti if we just understand its essence and internalise it.
So, let us look at this text. So, this is text seven of the Upadesamrta.

        syāt kṛṣṇa-nāma-caritādi-sitāpy avidyā-
        pittopatapta-rasanasya na rocikā nu
        kintv ādarād anudinaṁ khalu saiva juṣṭā
        svādvī kramād bhavati tad-gada-mūla-hantrī

So, "syāt kṛṣṇa-nāma-caritādi", so "kṛṣṇa-nāma-caritādi", everything
connected with Krishna, his name, his character, his pastimes, "ādi" means
his pastimes, and other things related with him. "sitā", "sitā" actually refers
to sweetness, sugar candy, Prabhupada translated. "āpy avidyā-", "avidyā-pitto",
so there is an implied comparison here. When there is an explicit comparison, he
was, he was as powerful as a lion. That is called a simile. When there is direct
comparison, his roar was lionine. That means lionine is like a lion. So, he,
that means there is a not implied compa..., there is an implied comparison,
not a stated comparison. So, here, there is implied comparison, that is called a
metaphor. So, "avidyā-" is compared to a "pitto", and "pi...", "pitto", when a
"tapta", "pittopatapta", when the person is afflicted by "pitto", "rasanasya na
rocikā nu", "rasana" is tongue, "na rocikā nu", when the tongue is afflicted by
"pitto", at that time, the, the bi..., because of that bile infection, he has
been referred to joints disease over here, then the person cannot taste anything
sweet.

"na rocikā nu", that which is "sitā", that which is sweet, cannot be tested,
tasted, relished, because of "pittopatapta". But the treatment in, according to
ayurveda, for joint disease "kintv ādarād anudinaṁ khalu saiva juṣṭā", if
somehow, "anudinaṁ", daily, regularly one keeps taking "ādarād", respectfully,
"juṣṭā", one keeps accepting it, then "svādvī kramād bhavati", then gradually
the sugar kane juice, which is sweet, it actually acts as a therapy, a cure for
the si..., si..., sickness. Then as a person gets cured, then the person awakens
the natural taste. And, "tad-gada-mūla-hantrī", the disease is destroyed from
the root. So, the point is that, the same thing which does not taste good, if we
keep taking it, it can cure us, and it will start tasting good. So:

"The holy name, character, pastimes and activities of Krishna are all transcendentally
sweet like sugar candy. Although the tongue of one afflicted by the jaundice of
avidya [ignorance] cannot taste anything sweet, it is wonderful that simply by
carefully chanting these sweet names every day, a natural relish awakens within
his tongue, and his disease is gradually destroyed at the root."

So, the disease is destroyed at the root. Let us see how this happens. Let us
look at Srila Prabhupada's purport here. So, here, there is a chart because of
the overview of the purport. So, the symptoms of disease are that there is no
taste for the name form. And the analogy that is given is for sugar candy,
jaundice. So, ev..., every disease has its particular symptom. And from the
symptom, you have to go back to the cause. So somebody can say, oh, I do not
find Krishna Consciousness relishable. I do not care for it. So, just, that is a
problem definitely. But the deeper problem is a misdirection of our heart. It is
avidya. So, avidya is not just ignorance in terms of philosophical ignorance. It
is ignorance in terms of ignorance about the right object of love. Now, what
happens? What is the cause of this disease? That is described in the next
section. That is individual. That, the, there is ignorance, avidya. And avidya,
what it leads to? Forgetfulness. And what is the forgetfulness that is being
talked about here? The forgetfulness is that:

        jivera svarupa hoy krsnera nitya das

and

        krishna bhuliya jiva bhoga vancha kare
        nikata aste maya taare jhapatiya dhare

So, these verses from the Caitanya Caritamrta are very important. Let us look at
them. First is, "jivera svarupa hoy krsnera nitya das", you know in this one
verse, the whole import of all the vedic wisdom is summarised by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu in one concise sutra like verse. "jivera svarupa hoy krsnera nitya
das". Eternal svarupa of the jiva is to serve the Lord. And it is with this
service attitude that the living entity thrives eternally. The Lord, so, this is
the eternal relationship which we have. Now, when we forget it:

        krishna bhuliya jiva bhoga vancha kare
        nikata aste maya taare jhapatiya dhare

So, how did the soul, who is in the eternal position of loving and serving
Krishna, how does the soul lose that position? That is "krishna bhuliya", if the
soul forgets Krishna. We can apply this in our sadhaka stage also. We are
practicing Krishna Consciousness, but if we are not careful, we forget Krishna.
"krishna bhuliya jiva", and then what happens? "bhoga vancha kare", we all have
the need for happiness. None of us can live without happiness. So, if we do not
get happiness in remembering and serving Krishna, naturally, our hunger for
happiness will need to be fulfilled somewhere else. So, therefore, "bhoga vancha
kare", therefore, the desire to enjoy comes up. And this "bhoga vancha kare",
what does it lead to do? It leads to do "nikata aste maya taare". So, now, I, I
want, I have the desire to enjoy, but some, maya is right next. That means
temptations are right there in our heart, and outside our heart. You know, in
our heart means, that all the past things that we have done wrong, they are
those impressions are there. They are pushing us. And outside the heart means,
around the world, there are so many temptations, and so "jhapatiya dhare", that
maya is situated very close by, "jhapatiya dhare", just catches the soul.

And then, once the soul gets caught in maya, at that time, those impressions
become stronger because of the indulgence, and then the grip of those impression
in future becomes even stronger. And then it is, becomes very difficult to
be released. So, this is how our disease increases. So, once the disease is
increased, soul is distracted by maya. "nikata aste maya taare jhapatiya dhare",
so when the maya catches the living entity, started with maya, then false or bad
shelter. Then, we do anything, somehow or the other, by doing this particular activity,
that particular activity, I will become happy. But all of these are "duracraya",
now, these are not going to be satisfied, they are all also false shelter, and
they are, they let us down. What are these false shelters that we think that?
Wealth will make me happy, sex will make me happy, power will make me happy, and
most of all, we think that the body will make me happy, but all of these, they
let us down. Ultimate the body turns into a source of misery for us. And the
conditioned souls somehow hope against hope, thinks that I will be able to enjoy.
So, actually, the history of universal defeat has not dampened the hope of eminent
victory for the conditioned soul, History of universal defeat, whoever has tried
in material existence to gain happiness, they all suffered, they all died.

So that there is a history of universal defeat. Everybody has defeated. But it
has not dampened the hope of eminent victory. The conditioned soul thinks, oh, I
will just gain, I will just gain this. This is, this is a quote from Ravindra
Svarupa Prabhu's book, endless love. He says, so, we all think that, I just now,
next day, tomorrow, next week, I will become happy. Now, certainly, we need hope
in life, but we do not need false hopes. We need true hopes. Material world,
things are not going to become better in terms of dead being a permanent
settlement. Certainly, in the material world, there are ups and downs. And when
there are downs, we do need hope that things will become better. But if we focus
all our efforts on just improving materially, then we are underutilising our
intelligence, and we are, actually, in many ways, misusing our energy. Because
if we just focus, let all our energy and intelligence focused, stay focused on
improving things materially, then it is a lost cause.

It is like trying to find a comfortable situation, ocean. Sometimes, the ways
may not be so jerky and strong, and the way the ocean may seem comfortable also.
But afterwards, when the waves used to come, it is going to toss and throw the
person up and down. So, this world is like a place with waves. So, that is why,
the scriptures tell us that work, whatever is required at the level of duty to
try to im..., keep things materially stable, but focus one's energy on spiritual
advancement. Because spiritual advancement is ultimately what will make us
happy. It will take us to eternal shelter. And that comes by the chanting of the
holy names. So, now, at an individual level, the soul forgets Krishna and gets
caught. And then, at a collective level, we will see that, at a collective
level, there is atheistic leadership.

So, atheistic leadership, what do we mean by that? Now, today's politicians,
today's leaders, they do not care for God at all. They may give some nominal lip
service to God if that helps them to get votes. There, there was a famous
politician, that person was an atheists. And in one of his books, he writes, I
just cannot understand how people can bow, bow down to stone images and imagine
that, there is, that is God, when actually there is no God. But he says, anyway,
in this country, because so many believe in these, these ancient books, which
talk tbout his sort of things. So, it is useful to have a working knowledge of
these things. And by this working knowledge, one can influence these leaders
towards doing good, it is people towards good things. So, the approach was I
will decide what is good and I will use the scriptures, quoting them
secta..., sectarianly, to make people do good things. And actually, what the
scriptures tell us about God and everything, that is all false. So, this is
misappropriation of God's words for one's own purposes.

And it is very demoniac, Prabhupada says. Just as Ravana wanted to enjoy Sita,
Lord Rama's property for his own pleasure. So, like that, there are people who,
if they are openly atheistic, they will say that there is no God, but in a, in
places where people have religious sentiments, and saying, I am, I do not
believe in God, that will not give them political awards. So, they will not say
that. What they simply say is, just, actually, do not take this God business
seriously. And we can quote some God verses, but I will tell you my programme,
then you will act according to my programmes. So, these people, what happens
because of them is, when people are misled by these blind leaders, at that
time, Prabhupada is blaming, Prabhupada said that they misled them, they are,
they are "na maa dunkatino", Krishnas quotes in 7.15. Those people do not
surrender to Him at all, and among them, there are "asuram bhavam asritah
mayayapahrta-jnana", those whose knowledge has been stolen away and those who
are openly demoniac. Today, oppose devotional endeavors. And they personally
never surrender to Krishna.

So, what are we talking about over here? They are talking about why people are
unable to have a taste for the chanting of the holy names. There is an individual
cause for it and there is a collective cause for it. So, we are looking at the
collective cause right now. The collective cause is that there is an overall
culture of materialism and atheism which bombards people and leaves no time,
energy or inclination to turn wholeheartedly towards spirituality. Now, people
may do some things religious, just because it looks good in a particular
culture, but that is far from a transformation imbibing or adoption of
spirituality. So, now, what is, once you understand the cause, then we look at
what is the cure? So, what is the cure? The cure is chanting of the holy names.
So, now, how do we chant? The method is we have to chant attentively. Svadvi, it
is said that kaludinam:

        anudinam adarat kintva adarad anudinam kaluse vista 

So, "adarat" is respectful, with care and attention. And then, actually, this is
the easy process for us to purify ourselves. Now, how does it, how is it easy?
Chanting does not require any yogic gymnastics. It does not require anything
which was very difficult to do. "ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam", as is quoted there. So,
actually, these two are different examples. One is that the mirror is there, the
dust is there on the mirror, so one cannot see anything over there. So, the
mirror, when the dust is removed, then one can see, use the mirror for its
purpose of seeing. So, similarly, when our mind is clean, then we can have clear
perception of reality. Otherwise, the perception remains unclear. And in fire
refers to how fire is covered by smoke. There are many places where the fire
metaphor is used, but generally, fire is covered by smoke, we remove the smoke
fire also refers to that which burns away dirt. So, our things that are
obstructing, and we burn to ashes by fire.

"mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaḿ", it extinguishes. There is another metaphor there that
because the fire is the cause of suffering, and fire can also be extinguished by
the chanting of the holy names. So, with respect to fire, we can have three
different metaphors and there are many actually. So, one is, that just as fire
is covered by smoke, similarly, the consciousness of the soul is covered by the
mo..., ignorance. This comes in the Bhagavad Gita, "dhumenavriyate vahnir",
3.38. And then, that is one metaphor.

So, then, by the process of purification, there is, the smoke can be removed and the
fire can blaze forward. So, like that, one can purify oneself by chanting. The
other metaphor of fire is, so here, fire is the original consciousness and smoke
is what is covering. And purification is removing the smoke.

The other is, metaphor is that the fire itself is the purifier, and the
impurities are like the f..., like the things that we want to burn away. So,
when we practice devotional service. Devotional service is like a flame which
awakens in our heart and that purifies us, frees us of all sinful reactions.
And then we move forward in spiritual life by that way.

So, after this, the other metaphor which we could understand over here is that
of fire itself is acting as the object which is burning, "saḿsāra-dāvānala", so
