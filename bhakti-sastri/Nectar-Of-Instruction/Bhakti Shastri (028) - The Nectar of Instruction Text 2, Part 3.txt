Hare Krishna.

Welcome back to our Nectar of Instruction part of the Bhakti Sastri course.

Today, we will conclude the second text which discusses six elements that are
contrary to bhakti. So out of the six, we have discussed four already: atyahara,
prayasa, prajalpa and niyamagraha. Now, we will discuss jana sanga and laulyam.

Like we discussed earlier, the point here is not to do hairsplitting analysis of
things. The point is to understand the broad principles. So, technically, we
might feel that there is some similarities between laulyam and atyahara. We will
discuss the slight differences that are there. But the important point is to
understand the broad principles.

So let us look at jana sanga. Now, in a sense, there is a correlation between
all of these things. See, when, when we have atyahara, when we have the urge to
accumulate more and more and more, then that leads to prayasa, because more
things do not come free. So we have to do prayasa. And when we do prayasa, then
we naturally have to, for the sake of prayasa, overendeavor, we have jana sanga.

We have the association of non-devotees. Because materialistic people are
engaged in overendeavor for the sake of material gratification. And when they
do jana, when they do jana sangha, materialistic people are greedy, so laulyam
also comes up.

So, atyahara is a tendency to accumulate more and more. Laulyam is a greed. So,
the two are related. There is subtle difference. So atyahara is something which
is more intrinsic. Laulyam is something which is more acquired. But overall,
the way Prabhupada explains it, the point is that atyahara is a little bit more
subtle, whereas laulyam is a bit, a bit more explicit. But then, when there is
jana sanga and laulyam, then naturally by that, when we are associating with
materialistic people, we end up talking materialistic things. So, there is
prajalpa.

And, as we associate with materialistic people who are not following any
principles, who do not follow any rules, then the result of that is we do not
feel the importance of those rules ourselves. Or materialistic people follow
rules because they feel that these are just rituals to be observed.

So both kinds of niyamagraha happen when see that, we associate with
non-devotees. So jana sanga in one sense is a very detrimental level of bad
association, jana sanga. And actually, Srila Prabhupada does not talk much about
it here. At the same topic is talked about in the next verse also, where it
talks in positive sense of what are the things that will stimulate our bhakti,
and Srila Prabhupada talks about that over here. So, we will look at jana sanga
today.

Jana sanga, sanga means association, jana is people. So, the devotees are called
as vishnu jana, or the gopis in the Tenth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, when they
are glorifying, those who glorify Krishna, they are called as "buridha janaha",
"jana" is people, "buridha", those who give the great charity. So "buri jana",
those who do good to others. But generally, the word "jana" itself is used here
in the sense of generi..., ordinary people.

So "jana sanga" is the association of ordinary people. When in the Bhagavad
Gita, Krishna describes that by associaton, desire develops. So in 2.62, He
says:

        dhyayato visayan pumsah
        sangas tesupajayate
        sangat sanjayate kamah
        kamat krodho 'bhijayate

So here, the sequence is one, but the word has many meanings. So "dhyayato"
contemplates the sense objects, then we develop attachment for them. And from
attachment, desires develop. So sanga, the word has double-meaning and the
meanings are related. One meaning of sanga is attachment. The other meaning of
sanga is association. So sanga, these two meanings are related because by
association attachment develops, and by attachment association is chosen. So if
somebody likes cricket, then that is the attachment. Then, if somebody comes,
that person comes to a hostel or comes to a new place, where he just resides for
work, then find out who are the other people who like cricket, and mix with
those people.

So by attachment, association develops, and by association also, attachment
develops. Now, if I say, from, if a person goes from India to America. And in
America, say, soccer is very popular. Then the person is staying in the hostel
over there, and everybody is mad for soccer, the person also develops attachment
for soccer over there, attachment develops for that. So these two are symbiotic,
by our attachment, we choose that kind of association, and by the kind of
assocation that is there around, then our attachments also develop.

So in the process of bhakti, we would like to have both of these spiritualised.
If you associate with devotees, then devotees have spiritual desires. They have
devotional attachments. And by their association, we will also develop
devotional attachments. When we see how seriously devotees are studying
scripture, trying to worship Krishna, trying to serve Krishna, then we will also
like loving, loving and serving Krishna, so by that association, attachment to
Krishna will develop. And similarly, if we have some attachment to Krishna, so
then when we go to a particular place, we will try to seek out, where are
devotees over there. And we will try to associate with those devotees, so these
two can, this reciprocity, this symbiotic nature of association, attachment can
be, work in our favor.

Now here, the word sanga primarily refers to assocation. So, jana sanga refers
to at association of wordly minded people. Now, what exactly happens when we
associate with worldly minded people? Before we understand that, let us first
understand what we mean by association. Now, association is not just a physical
proximity. Physical proximity can be there without having association. How is
that possible? That happens because we say, have the spiritual master,
Prabhupada would give this example, sitting on a vyasasana, and there is fly,
sitting on the body of the spiritual master, irritating the spiritual master.
So, the fly is having physical con..., proximity to the spiritual master, but
the fly is getting no benefit.

Is the fly association with the spiritual master? No, the fly is just simply
associating with potential food, with some, maybe it can get, bite and it can
get some blood, it can get some pass, so it is, it has no capacity to understand
what it is doing from the spiritual perspective. Therefore, just physical
proximity in and of itself is not association. The, of course, physical
proximity generally shapes and affects most people.

So then what exactly is assocation? Association essentially means emotional
exchanges. So whenever we associate with someone, we have sharing of emotions.
We try to give our emotions to them, and they give their emotions to us. So,
whenever that happens, the transfer of emotions, when that happens, that is
association. Sometimes, in the temple, there are some employees. Now, those
employees come to the temple. If they are not devotees, and if they are not
inclined to become devotees, then they come to the temple, they may come for
twenty-five years to the temple.

Or sometimes, next to the temple, there are people who are staying as
neighbours. Now, for whatever reason, they do not, they do not become inclined
to devotional service, and they are having physical proximity with so many
devotees, but their hearts do not change because their emotional world is
entirely different from the devotees' emotional world, from Krishna's emotional
world, and they do not strive to bring about an intersection between the two.
Because of this, lack of intersection between the two, the result is that there
is just no transfer of emotions, and because of no transfer of emotions,
effectively, there is no association. Although there may be physical proximity.

So, association means transfer of emotions. And emotions are integrally
connected with desires. So somebody, say there is some..., somebody comes from
Africa or maybe some part of the world, not South Africa, but other countries in
Africa where cricket is unknown, and that person comes as a student to India to
study in an Indian College, and Indian students are just mad for cricket. And
then, the cricket match, and the, and the final over, the Indian, Indian teams
wins by hitting a sixer, and then the whole hostel erupts enjoy. And this
person, what is happening over here? Nothing makes sense for him. But then, just
by seeing the excitement of everyone, there is an infectious effect. Now, the
infectious effect can be positive or negative, depending on the nature of what
is going on in the association. So that person gets affected, and the desires
develop accordingly.

So, when there is a transfer of emotions, when that person, everybody is
celebrating, and this person also joins the celebration, and because who does
not want to celebrate ultimately? Everybody wants to be happy in life, so if
people are happy, they are celebrating, this person joins the celebration, and
by, by engaging those emotions, that person's soul gets the desires. So, what is
the difference between emotions and desires? They are very similar, but the
difference is that, emotions are more like feelings which come to us. And
desires are our at..., our aspirations for certain things, our, our cravings for
certain things. Aspirations are used generally in a positive sense, craving is
often used in a negative sense. But essentially, both are the same power.

So, desires produce emotions, emotions produce desires. Now, the, when we enjoy
the emotions that materialistic people are enjoying, then we get the desires
that they are having. And those desires are often non-devotional, because those
desires are non-devotional, or sometimes even anti-devotional. So non-devotional
desires means people want to just, say, as I said, talk about cricket, talk
about politics. Now that there is no direct breaking of the regulative
principles involved in this, so they are non-devotional. But if somebody talks
about sensuality, sexuality, and talks about such things. Then that is involving
breaking of the regulative principles. So that is anti-devotional.

So in jana sanga, there can be non-devotional and there can be anti-devotional.
And both are detrimental, but anti-devotional is far far more detrimental.
Non-devotional can be value neutral, and non-devotional can help us to move
forward. You know, without much disturbance, if we do not get infected by any
desires excessively. So now, Srila Prabhupada gives the example that any person
who wants to do something, you know, and wants to do in an effective way, tries
to create association. So there can be an association of bankers, association of
stock brokers, association of golf players. There are so many cul..., clubs, in
which people try, like-minded people try to come together and do the things
which they want, which they like to do.

Similarly, he says, we got this Krishna Consciousness movement. What is the
purpose of the Krishna Consciousness movement? To bring, to provide a forum, for
those who are interested in Krishna to come together and nourish their
attraction to Krishna. So, in the Krishna Conscious movement, we learn who is
Krishna, what is our relationship with Him, why we should love Him, and how we
should love Him. So, all these are very important things for a devotee. And in
the Krishna Conscious association, we learn all these things. So this is "sadhbir
bhaktir prasadyaticu" should happen if you come in the association of devotees.

And in fact, a large part of this book will talk about how good association
works and how good association nourishes us. Here, we will focus on how bad
association can affect us. So, I will talk about three things, three levels of
bad, affect of bad association. One is bad affect, association affecting our
desires. Second is association, bad, bad association affecting our intelligence.
And third is bad association affecting our faith. These are progressively deeper
and more dangerous.

So, we, first is bad association affecting our desires. That means, see, desires
come and go. Sometimes, we are just walking along the street, and see some
sight, and suddenly a strong desire comes up, and we feel contaminated, we feel
tucked by that desire, but then it is a temporary desire, and then maybe the
intelligence comes back online, hey, I should not be doing this thing.
And intelligence comes back and there is not too much damage. So this can happen
temporarily. Say, this scriptural example for this is Skala Krishna Das. Now,
Skala Krishna Das was with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and when he was with Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, he was actually experiencing the extraordinary pastimes of Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. Actually, South India preaching tour was probably the most
extraordinary teaching tour. 14:14
