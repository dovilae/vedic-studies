Hare Krishna.

Welcome back to our Nectar of Instruction course. We are discussing currently
mantra two, text two here. So we discussed the first two parts of this verse,
atyahara and prayasa. Now, we will describe, discuss the remaining parts. So
here we have the slide, which was, now, we are going to discuss prajalpa,
niyamagrahah, jana-sangah, and laulyam.

So, prajalpa. Prajalpa. Jalpa means talk. Prajalpa means useless talk. Prajalpa.
So, the point is not that we have to become silent, but we have to know how, what is
the most productive talk for us as spiritualists.

So, we may wonder what is the relationship between the first part and the second
part. That means the first verse talked about certain aspects which a person has
to give up. And now this verse is talking about some other aspects which ... (?,
01:08) can harm us also spiritually. So is there a relationship? In one sense,
"vacho vega" may seem very similiar to prajalpa. And here, Prabhupada also used
the example of a frog, which also seems similar.

So, essentially, they may be similar, but the frame of analysis is different.
The first is talking from the perspective of the body. The body, the mind, the
urges, which, the va..., which can harm a person on the spiritual path. But the
focus there is on the bodily urges. Here, the focus is more from the spiritual
perspective.

Now, if we look at the previous verse, my verse, essentially controlling those
vegas is important for all transcendentalists. It is a generic description that
is given. Whereas, here it is described, it is from a devotional perspective,
that these six activities will harm the bhakti-lata-bija.

        sadbhir bhaktir vinasyati

So of course there can be coincidences, that certain things which can be
materially harmful, and spiritually harmful also. For example, intoxication. You
know, it is spiritually detrimental. It is materially also detrimental. Or we
can have also nowadays eating non-vegetarian food, is being increasingly
recognised to be materially also unhealthy, and it is spiritually, it is
extremely undesirable. So there can be co..., overlaps. But then the
perspectives are different.

From the material perspective, some people may say certain things are good, but
from the spiritual perspective, they may not necessarily be good. So the point
here is that there can be overlap, but the focus in both the analyses is
different. That here the focus is on the bhakti, what is anikul to bhakti, and
what is pratikul to bhakti. So let us look at prajalpa. So I said, jalpa means
speech. Prajalpa means actually speech that is harmful, that is detrimental. So,
it is similar to "vacho vega".

Now, it is interesting that Vishvapitamaha in his instructions talks about
speech to Yudishtira. That is one of the longest sections in the whole
Mahabharata. Just like there are eighteen chapters in the Bhagavad Gita,
similarly there are eighteen Parvas in the Mahabharata. And the longest among
the Parvas, there is the, there is Bhishma Parva which at the start of the,
start of the war takes places, where long description is there. Similarly the
long conversation that we see, one long conversation is the conversation between
Dharma and Yudishtira, very long conversation.

Similarly the long conversation between Yudistir and Bhishma. So there, when
Bhishma is instruction, instructing Yudishtira in raja dharma, he explains that
how should a person speak. And he gives a hierarchy. So he says, this is an
adaptation of what he is speaking for our analysis. So he says that the best
speech is about the Lord, the glorification of the Lord. Then, he says is
pleasing speech. The he says is truthful speech. Then below that he says is
useless speech. And then is blasphemous speech.

So, there is five ways of analysing. Like that there can be different ways, but
here, speak about the Absolute Truth, speech, sweet speech, truthful speech,
useless speech, and blasphemous speech.

So, anything that is blasphemous, anything that is useless, that will all come
under prajalpa. Now, it is interesting that he places sweet speech above
truthful speech. Now, Krishna also when he is describing in the Bhagavad Gita,
in the seventeenth chapter, he talks about austerity of speech. And there He
says:

        anudvega-karam vakyam
        satyam priya-hitam ca yat
        svadhyayabhyasanam caiva
        van-mayam tapa ucyate

So He describes "anudvega-karam vakyam", "anudvega-karam", that "vakya" which
does not agitate others. "satyam priya-hitam ca yat", that is which is truthful,
that is which is pleasing, that is beneficial. And then "svadhyayabhyasanam
caiva", reciting of the Vedic scriptures, all these are "van-mayam tapa ucyate",
they are austerities of the speech. That this means that all these are
austerities by which one can spiritualise one's speaking power.

By doing these activities, our speaking power will not get dissipated, but we
will have the opportunity to uti.., utilise it more and more for Krishna's sake.
So, in general, those speeches which are detrimental to our spiritual life,
those we should avoid. Now what are the speeches that are detrimental?
So, certainly, blasphemous speech is detrimental. So, we discussed earlier what
"vacho vegam", where people want to talk about all sorts of, hundreds of, there
are so many channels. There are so many chat rooms. There are so many messaging
systems and there is so much unproductive talk that is happening.

But in this context, because we focus on bhakti, we will talk something more
specific here. We will talk about how devotees can engage in talks that can be
detrimental to one's bhakti. So these can be of two gra..., broad categories.

One is those which are blasphemous, and those which are rumor based. See,
blasphemous means that there is, we are speaking bad about devotees and the
whole purpose is to malign the devotee by that. Now, the important point is not
that whether it is true or false. The, if the intention is to malign the
devotee, that can be offensive to our spiritual life. It can be injurious, very
very injurious. So, it is the mad elephant offense coming. And it can destroy
our bhakti-lata-bija.

So, there is, beyond that, rumor based speak, speech. Rumor based speech means
we hear. Say, as devotees, we have certain moral standards all of us are
expected to follow. And anybody can have difficulties in following those moral
standards. Now, when somebody has some difficulties and somebody falls at that
time, then they need our help. At the very least, we can offer a prayers. If you
can offer any practical help to them, we need, they need help from us.

Now, imagine if a warrior is going on a war field, and that wa..., warrior gets
wounded. And when that person is wounded, the person should be sent to the
hospital. But imagine if a warrior is wounded, and because of that, the person
swa..., because of getting wounded in the war, the warrior is sent to a jail.

What happens? Now, if we send to the jail, those who need the hospital, are we
being compassionate? Actually, we are being violent in a way. So, all devotees,
no matter who externally in a position advanced they may be, they all have their
challenges in the practice of spiritual life. And if somebody has some
difficulties. Somebody has some slips, some falls, then they need a hospital.
There are a very few devotees who actually come with the intention to be
hypocritical.

Generally, while Srila Prabhupada's mercy, we have such high standards, that if
a person just wants to enjoy, then the material world offers better prospects for
enjoyment than the disciplines of Krishna Consciousness and subsequent
enjoyment, that a person may get, after following those disciplines.

So, there are people who are sincere, who try to practice, but for whatever
reasons, they fall. Now, when they fall, if we can help, that is well and good.
If we cannot help them, then best is not to talk about it. Because what are we
doing by it? Are we maki..., are we going to make any spiritual advancement by
talking about the fall of some devotee? No, we are not going to make any. Only,
if it is generally in the mood, in a way of trying to learn what was wrong in
it. Then, maybe something can be learnt.

But even then, especially when an event has happened, then after that the
emotional impact of the event is far greater than the rational analysis. And so,
we cannot learn much if some devotee had that some problem. Ok, at lea..., at
the very least, we should not be a part of the rumor mongering group that goes
around talking about those things. If somebody has that problem, yes, now it is
between that person and Krishna, that person and the authority over there who is
aware of this.

Now, I have not come to Krishna Consciousness movement to gossip about people.
