Hare Krishna.

Welcome back to the Nectar of Instruction. We are continuing now with the text:

        dīkṣā...
        kṛṣṇeti yasya giri taṁ manasādriyeta

So, we will discuss a few points. There is a lot of important point that Srila
Prabhupada makes in his purport. So, I will discuss a few points. Let us look at
this powerpoint over here. So, we see, we discussed most of it, but here we will
see, the bottom. How a person interacts with uttama adikari. So, we go with
faith, and we inquire. When we inquire, we associate, and we serve. So, it is
said that there is, we inquire, and then when in the process of inquiry, we become
more close, we learn association. And then in the association, we serve. And
then serve, when we serve a person, our faith in that person increases again.
And greater faith, we make more, mo..., deeper, more intimate inquiries. And
then that deepens our relationship, the association becomes even deeper.

Then, so, it begi..., faith, inquiry, association, service. It goes on
cyclically like that. It is an ever deeping cycle. So, it is said that actually
when we associate with the mahabhagavata, you know, it is a true leader is one
who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way. A true leader is who knows
the way. That means this is the way I should go. And not only knows the way, it
is, actually after doing the way, often going along the way is not easy. It
requires a lot of struggle. So, leader sets the example, and goes the way. And
then actually, tr..., goes to the journey, which one has to go through. And then
finally shows the way. Ok, this is how you should go. So, this is actually the
characteristic of a true leader and we see this in Srila Prabhupada, in the way
he lived and shared Krishna Consciousness with others.

So, a leader is one who knows the way. Now, Srila Prabhupada, he internalised
the Vedic scriptures based on hearing from his spiritual master, studying his
spiritual master's books, and studying the previous acharyas' books, in addition
of course to living right from his chil..., early childhood in a very devotional
atmosphere that was very carefully protected and cultivated by his devotee
father Gour Mohon Dev whom Srila Prabhupada called, calls in his Krishna book as
a pure devotee. And then, he is also talking about, he also learnt what he had
learnt in a cultural sense from his father. He learnt fro..., in a philosophical
sense from his spiritual father, his Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur. And then
with those, both those assets, Srila Prabhupada, he actually knew the way.

When he knew the, now, here, we are not talking about Srila Prabhupada as a
person who descended from the spiritual world. That is there definitely. Srila
Prabhupada has spoken that on intimate occasions to a f..., cer..., to a few of
his disciples that Krishna sent him from the spiritual world. But Srila
Prabhupada never claimed that that was the basis of his authority for preaching.
He said my authority for preaching is because my spiritual master has instructed
me to, and Caitanya Mahaprabhu's prophecy was already there. And fulfilling the
prophecy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the responsibility of every soul.

So, of every follower of Caitanya Mahaprabhu, ultimately every soul, because
every soul is a follower of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, but at least those who have
accepted Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu as their worshipable Lord, it is their
responsibility to fulfill the prophecy. And Srila Prabhupada would say that one
time at an intimate meeting with his godbrothers, his godbrothers were trying
to, one of his godbrothers was saying that, you know, this whole putri, maybe at
that time people thought putri was just India, and that is why all over India,
the holy name will be chanted and Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur has already
done that.

Prabhupada said no. Actually, putri means the whole world. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu said it will happen. So, at that time, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakur was healing and he was, he would not have lived for very long. So then,
the devotees said who will do that? So then, Srila Prabhupada became grave and
he said, some fool will do it. Some fool will do it. What does that mean? You
know, Prabhupada said that, you know, if we just have too much faith in our
rational intelligence, how will this happen? How will that happen? How will that
happen? Then, our rational intelligence makes us think that sharing Krishna
Consciousness in this Kali Yuga is mission impossible. It is not possible. Who
is going to hear? But when we base our thinking, not just on our logic, but on
faith in Krishna, and on the transcendental logic that with Krishna, everything
is possible. And whoever k..., chooses to become an instrument of Krishna,
Krishna can empower that person. So, with this faith, when we work, then we
understand that sharing Krishna Consciousness and the subsequence spread of
Krishna Consciousness all over the world is not mission possible. Actually, it
is mission unstoppable. It is mission unstoppable. Because who can stop Krishna?
Krishna is all powerful. And it is his mission. And it will be spread all over
the world.

So, Srila Prabhupada said that some fool will do it. So, what he meant by that
fool was, one does, does not have too much faith in one's own logic and
rationality of how it will be possible. One just does what one can and then
Krishna makes the arrangements. So, we see it is said that there are various
definitions of faith. One general understanding of faith is faith is to take one
step up a staircase when we cannot see the full staircase. Take one step at a
time, one step at a time, one step at a time. Along the direction that Krishna
wants us to go. Just keep taking one step, one step, one step. And then Krishna
will reveal the way to us. So, Srila Prabhupada knew the way means it was not
that he knew exactly when he will, when he will go to New York, what will happen
when he will go to New York, and how he will meet different devotees, and they
will become devotees, and how he will send them all over the world.

Srila Prabhupada had a vision, in the sense that, not a mystical vision, but a
vision in the sense that, our deep faith which also led to visualisation within
his heart, that actually there are temples, there are devotees, just time which
is separating us from them. So, of course, we call the mystical vision also. But
the point was Srila Prabhupada was, he knew the way, not in the details, but in the
broad principle of faith. What Caitanya Mahaprabhu was saying has to happen. So,
he knew the way. And then, not only that he knew the way, as so a devotee can be
passive. Oh, it is Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu's prophecy. He is Supreme Lord. He
will fulfill it. No. A devotee does not think like that. A devotee thinks, I
have to do it.

You know, if I love my Lord, then his words, making them true is my
responsibility. You know, that is what a devotee, that is the meaning of
surrender. That is the meaning of dedication. That is the meaning of commitment.
You know, that is what Krishna tells Arjuna that you fight. And what does Arjuna
say?

       kariṣhye vachanaṁ tava

Srila Prabhupada says in a lecture that, Kr... Arjuna does not say, oh, Krishna,
you are God. That you kill all the enemies. I will just sit by your side and I
need bang.  I will be doing bang. Prabhupada is making a caricature of pseudo
spiritualists over there. He says that the devotee takes responsibility for
Krishna's mission. So, Prabhupada had that sense of responsibility. That Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu's prophecy is my responsibility. And Srila Prabhupada went
the way. He led. He knows the way in the sense that he had the faith that it
will happen, and he knew that the Lord's, nothing can stop the Lord's will from
actualising. But he himself took the responsibility. He goes the way.

So, Srila Prabhupada, you know, himself physically all over, traveled in an
extraordinary way for so ma..., such a long time in his life. You know, at a,
such a long, so vigorously, at such an advanced age, you know, and for long long
time. Srila Prabhupada went around the world fourteen times almost, in the last
ten, eleven years of his life. Even from a material point of view, that is a
remarkable feet. And it is not that Srila Prabhupada was traveling and
sightseeing. He was constantly busy. He was barely sleeping for a few hours at
night, and sharing Krishna Consciousness with enormous vigor. So, actually, he
went, he we..., worked harder than anyone else. You know, we sometimes say
that pure devotees are empowered, is, empowerment is there. But empowerment does
not mean that there are no obstacles. You know, empowerment means even when
there are obstacles, the devotee perseveres.

And that, in one sense, the determination to go on is the empowerment. And, you
know, sometimes, maybe in old movies, you might have seen in a Rama..., Ramayana
on television was there, so there is a rakshasa which shoots an arrow and the,
and the some Lord Rama or Lakshman, somebody will shoot on arrow. And both
arrows together, and one arrow falls off, one arrow just falls off. So, like
that, most often what happens is, when we have some determination to serve
Krishna and when some obstacle comes, so two arrows collide, our determination
falls off. It is, I cannot do it. Leave it. It is too complex, too, too
difficult.

But with Srila Prabhupada, no matter how many big obstacles came, tuck, tuck,
everything just fell off and Srila Prabhupada went on, went on, went on. So, he
went the way. The kind of difficulty that Srila Prabhupada was, faced was
unbelievable. The difficulties were multiple. It was at one level that the
difficulties were that he was, his own body was aging, and he was wake, he was
all alone, and when later on he got very dedicated devotees, but even they
had difficulties in following the spiritual standards, their difficulties in
interrelating with each other. They had difficulties in presenting Krishna
Consciousness for the world properly. They misrepresented sometimes. They, then,
there were difficulties of being in a foreign country where devotees were
labeled as cultists. And then they had to fight court cases. Sometimes, the
devotees were abducted, and brainwashed.

So, sometimes, devotees were arrested and put in jail. So, there were actually
multiple difficulties for Srila Prabhupada. But he just went own and
unaffectedly, tirelessly preaching. So, he goes the way and then he shows the way.
Srila Prabhupada not only went on heroically preaching, but he also shared how
you should do it. He says do as I have done and share Krishna Consciousness with
the world. So, he went the way and he showed the way. He actually, Srila
Prabhupada in one lecture says that, not just one lecture, several places he
said, actually, this Krishna Conciousness movement is practically invented by
me. You know, invented by me does not mean that it was concocted, but invented
in the sense that how people with wes..., with cultural upbringing, that was a
radically different from the traditional cultural upbringing, how they could be
engaged in devotional service.

How people who have never heard about Krishna, how they could be inspired and
engaged in such a way that they could give their life to Krishna. Srila
Prabhupada used to mean this devotional creativity for them. The way Srila
Prabhupada started Ratha Yatra, we discussed that earlier, how, you know, the
hippies like to do outlandish things, and Srila Prabhupada started Ratha Yatra,
whichwas the most outlandish thing that they could think of, you know, dancing
in the streets and not only that, Srila Prabhupada started book distribution.
Now, the tradition was that brahmacaris go and beg. But Srila Prabhupada said
begging is not respectable, so you go and give something, and then ask for
charity. And book distribution become such a tremendous phenomenal means of not
only sharing of wisdom, but also increasing the lakshmi in the service of
Krishna.

So, Srila Prabhu..., in India, he came and he made life membership. So, Srila
Prabhupada came off with many different schemes and plans by which not only to
share Krishna Consciousness, but also to engage the devotees. So, he kept the
principles the same, the sambadya jnani kept the same, but abidheya, Prabhupada
was tremendously innovative, in terms of how to get devotees to practice
devotional service. Sambadha is the philosophical understanding that I am a
servant of Krishna, the basic philosophical knowledge. Srila Prabhupada did not
change sambadha. That is, he kept the points very clear that I am the, I am the
Lor..., err, I am the servant of Krishna. That he did not cha..., change any
way. But abidheya, how we should be fo..., connected with Krishna. So, amanda,
vidheya, prayojana, these are three primary aspects, of actually of any process.
You know, if a person wants to say, says the advertisement. And then, ok, there
is a car advertisement. Then, the person sees the car advertisement and the
person thinks, oh, I want that car. That car advertisement says, pu..., purchase
them, enjoy this car, purchase this car, and enjoy the envy in your neighbor's
eyes.

So, it is, it is such a degraded standard, you know, we are thinking my
enjoyment will be the envy in others' eyes, but whatever. Person sees the car
and sambandhana is established. Oh, I want that car. So, first we und..., there
is, we look at that object, we come to know about that object, and then we want
to develop a relationship with that object. Then after that, there is avidheya.
There is a process. Ok, how do I develop? Now, I understood this is the object
with which I want to develop a relationship. How do I develop that relationship?
So, that is, a process for that. So, I, I withdraw money from my bank, and go to
the car show room, and purchase the car. If I do not dive that, then I worked my
plan to get a loan. If I cannot get a loan, then I will do savings, and then
based on, mortgage something, then I go to the car show room, and then I decide
to purchase the car.

So, so, avidheya is the process by which we develop the sambandha. Sambandha is
basically knowledge.

        sambandha kṛṣṇa bhakti abhidheya prema prayojana

In Caitanya Caritamrta says. And then what happens when I ride in the car and ride
in the car and then we go right by my nu..., neighbor's house, I am about to
enjoy the envy in the neighbor's eyes, and I find that he is riding in a more
modern car than what I have got. And then instead of enjoying the envy in his
eyes, he enjoys the envy in my eyes. So, it is a distressing and devastating
anticlimax for me. So, generally, the prayojana, in terms of happiness, it is
al..., almost always an anticlimax in material life. So, but the principle is
that in everything, this is how you work, sambandhana, abhidheya, prayojana. The
movies, they show that there is a boy and a girl, and somehow, they are
traveling through a building and both of them get trapped with the same lift at
the same time, and the lift, lift electricity goes off, and they look at each
other, and when they touch with the some, they feel that the electric current
flows through their body, and they think we want to develop sambandhana.

And then, after that, the whole movie, where maybe the girl's parents suppose,
the boy's parents suppose, and then there is fighting, there is
misunderstanding, and there are all kinds of complexities, that is the whole
thing is abhidheya. And then, the prayojana that they show is, and they lived
happily ever after. Now, that prayojana is not true. Because actually nobody
lives happily ever after. We discussed how, when we say, happily ever after,
this is exactly the opposite of what Bhagavad Gita teaches. Bhagavad Gita
teaches "duhkhalayam asasvatam". So, nobody lives ever after is "asasvatam", And
this "duhkhalayam", nobody lives happily.

But the point is, this sambandha, abhidheya, prayojana is there everywhere. So,
now, sambandha, we, Prabhupada gives the philosophical knowledge to explain how
Krishna is the all attractive supreme Lord. And we have to develop a
relationship with him. So, that is sambandha. Then, abhidheya is how do I
develop my relationship? That is by the process of bhakti. So, how is the
process of bhakti to be practiced in the modern times. That Prabhupada explains,
is process invention, so many different ways he came up by which he could engage
devotees. 16:10
