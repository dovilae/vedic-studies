Hare Krishna.

Welcome back to the Bhakti Sastri, Nectar of Instruction.

Today, we will start with text four. So, in the fourth text, Rupa Goswami talks
about association. It is the first verse and this theme will go on in the next
verses. The connection is that, in the previous two verses, he was talking about
association. And the emphasize has been on avoiding bad association and taking
good association. So, now, how do we take good association? That is described in
this mantra, in this particular verse. So let us look at the
one's. So:

        dadāti pratigṛhṇāti
        guhyam ākhyāti pṛcchati
        bhuṅkte bhojayate caiva
        ṣaḍ-vidhaṁ prīti-lakṣaṇam

So "dadāti pratigṛhṇāti", "dadāti" means to give. "pratigṛhṇāti" means to
receive, "gṛhṇā", "gṛhṇā", is accept, so "guhyam", "guhyam" is confidential.
"ākhyāti pṛcchati", "ākhyāti" means to ask, and "pṛcchati" is to hear.

"bhuṅkte bhojayate caiva", "bhuṅkte" is to receive, to eat, and "bhojayate" is
nto feed others. So, "bhojayate", let, "bhojana", so one is to enjoy. In other
word, "bhuṅkte" often means enjoy. So, actually devotees can be happy in taking
prasadam. That is not wrong. "bhuṅkte bhojayate caiva", we will discuss about
that la..., "ṣaḍ-vidhaṁ prīti-lakṣaṇam", "prīti" is affection, "lakṣaṇam" is
symptoms. So, these are the six symptoms of friendship.

It is interesting that bhakti is an inner cultivation. And yet, while describing
how one can go about practicing bhakti, Rupa Goswami delineates specific
activities which may seem to be external. You know, giving gifts, receiving
gifts, is external activity, we may say. You know, eating food, drinking food,
that may also seem to be external. We say, ok, talking about our hearts, that is
internal. But that may be more internal. But what about others? Actually
speaking, you know, for us, we inter..., we live in the world, and we l..., we
look through our eyes at the external world. When people see us, they first see
us externally. And in many cases, people see us only externally.

You know, among thousands of people who see us, during our life, course of our
life, how many people can see our heart? So, external behavior, external actions
are also important. Now, in a later verse, he will talk about how we should not be
stuck with the external vision and we should see devotees spiritually also. But
externals are not unimportant. They are important. And bhakti, the bhakti
culture, that way, if you wanted to talk about externals negatively, we could
say the bhakti culture is filled with so many externals. The way, we,  we wear
tilak, we were dhoti, kurta or saaris, we are so, we wear kunti mala. So, there
are so many external things that we do.

Why do we do that? Because the external helps in accessing the internal. So,
when we want to interact with other people, other devotees especially. How do we
do that? There ha..., what is in the heart has to be expressed externally. And
when it is expressed externally, then that expression becomes understandable and
relishable for others. Otherwise, it is not even accessible. Leave alone
understandable or relishable. Accessible means one can contact it, understandable
means intellectually one can grasp it, relishable means at the heart's level, we
relish it. So what is in the heart, is not e..., not even accessible to others,
most of the time, leave alone understandable or relishable.

That is why the heart's affection has to be expressed. So, that is why he uses the
word very clearly, Rupa Goswami, laksanam. These are the laksanas. These are
symptoms of "prīti", so "prīti" has to be in the heart. If "prīti" is not in the
heart, one can do these six things superficially also. That is possible. But
even if "prīti" is in the heart, how will others know that the "prīti" is there?
These things have to be done. And, the, so, the externals of bhakti should not
be dismissed as rituals. That, oh, these are rituals, why do them? No, they are
the ways in which, affection is expressed, and then affection is received by
others.

So that is why it is extremely important that devotees follow the culture and
this is a very important part of the culture. So, we will discuss this verse
based on Srila Prabhupada's purport and we look at also, parallel instances,
from especially the Caitanya Carimtamrta. Because the bhakti culture is most
directly demonstrated, especially in terms of relationships among devotees in
the Caitanya Caritamrta. So, therefore, it is, move forward, now, Srila
Prabhupada, look at the translation.

"Offering gifts in charity, accepting charitable gifts, revealing one's mind in
confidence, inquiring confidentially, accepting prasada and offering prasada are
the six symptoms of love shared by one devotee and another."

So, the six ways in which loving exchanges are done, symptoms of love. Let us
look at the purport, so, purport can be divided into various parts whom to
associate with, where to associate, that is within Krishna Consciousness
movement, ISKCON. Then how, and why. And then there is one whole section on why
we should, with whom we should not associate. So, Srila Prabhupada gives the
example of how relationships are formed even in material life. You know, when,
say, the head of state, Prabhupada uses the example of businessman, and gives a
similar example from, see, the political scenario. When they say the head of
state of one country visits another country. What does second country do?

They should honor of, honor of, anchoress honor. So, they have a big feast. And
then many VIPs are there. And then they sit and talk with each other. And that
is relationships develop. So, what essentially happens is maybe if they want
to develop some relationship, then, this fron...,  the, the visiting countries,
head of state, the visitor, visiting head of state, will bring some, give
mentor, some gift and he will give to the, to the host head of state. The host
will give some gifts. They will have a big feast together. And they will talk
about matters of mutual concern.

You know, for them, their mutual concern may be national. You know, my nation,
your nation, how, what are the areas of disagreement? What are the areas of
possibility of increasing relationships? And these talks can be of pivotal
importance for political consequences. So, therefore, this is the way
reciprocations happen. Relationships happen this way only in life. So, generally
speaking, the way is that these six activities, that Rupa Goswami gas talked
about are universal. That everybody does these activities. It is not just
devotees, but when devotees do these, then they can bring Krishna into their
hearts, into each other's hearts, and they can both move closer to Krishna.

So, so principles of living, many of them are similar for devotees and
non-devotees. But the purpose of living is different. Now, devotees eat food.
Non-devotees eat food. The principle is the same. Everybody has to eat food.
Devotees have to work to earn a living. Non-devotees have to work to earn a
living. Devotees have to, devotees maintain a family, non-devotees maintain a
family. So, many of the activities are similar. The principles are common, but
the purposes are different. The principle, by principle, I do not mean a
philosophical understanding. The, the, by principle, I mean, just the fact that
we have to do those activities. The purpose is different. So these six ways, in
which people exchange affection, these when devotees apply it, then there can be
very affectionate relationship.

And Srila Prabhupada in fact goes to the extent of saying, that the Krishna
Consciousness movement is nourished by these six full exchanges between the
devotees. So, this is a profound statement. Generally, we may think of six full,
it is a Krishna Consciousness movement as meant for Krishna Consciousness with
the world. As we want to conduct programmes and we want to give cla..., we have
classes. Then many people becoming devotees. Many books being distributed.
Temples being built. Yes, these are important. They are definitely important.
And they are signs of the vibrancy of the Krishna Consciousness movement's
health. But the same time, what is the essence? What we want after people come
to the temple, after co..., people come to Krishna, what happens after that?
Now, they have to develop loving relatioinship with other devotees.

Now, our heart gets connected with Krishna, not through some mystical vision
that Krishna suddenly reveals to us. Our heart gets connected to Krishna, by
getting connected to his devotees.

    prasaṅgam ajaraṁ pāśam
    ātmanaḥ kavayo viduḥ
    sa eva sādhuṣu kṛto
    mokṣa-dvāram apāvṛtam

So, it is described in the Srimad Bhagavatam, Third Canto, that "prasaṅgam",
"prasaṅgam" means attachment. "prasaṅgam", "prasaṅgam ajaraṁ pāśam", the "pāś",
the nose of attachment is "ajaraṁ". "jaraṁ" is old age, "ajaraṁ" is that which
never grows old. So, the attachments to material things is such that they never
grow old. In fact, we see our bad habits. The older they get, they do not get
weaker. They get stronger quite often. They never grow and weak. The longer a
habit has been there, the more difficult it is to give up. So, material
attachments are "ajaraṁ".

"prasaṅgam ajaraṁ pāśam ātmanaḥ kavayo viduḥ", now, wise people know that
attachment to the materialists almost impossible to break, to give up. But
then "sa eva sādhuṣu kṛto", if the same is directed towards devotees, towards
sadhus, then "mokṣa-dvāram apāvṛtam", then the doors to liberation open.

So, the, it is by attraction to Krishna's devotees that we develop attraction to
Krishna. Now, the word sadhu does not necessarily, may have to mean a, the
spiritual master, or sannyasi guru. It can be any advanced devotee, any devotee,
any person, male or female,grihasta or sannyasi, whoever inspires us to develop
our love for Krishna, to increase our service to Krishna. That can be a sadhu
for us. So, it is by attraction to Krishna and his devotees that our love for
Krishna, th..., gets nourished in a practical sense. So, when people come to the
temples, what is that there is su..., going to happen to them? What should
happen is that they become attracted and connected with devotees in a deeper and
deeper level, and through that, they move forward, upwards towards Krishna.

So, we associate with devotees, now, we see in ISKCON, wha..., what do we
actually do? We have essentially, we have hearing and chanting, that is in a
sense, "guhyam ākhyāti pṛcchati". Actually speaking, the Bhagavatam class that
is there, the Gita class that is that are there, the various programmes that are
there, they are not just philosophical classes. Philosophy is very important.
And when we say "guhyam ākhyāti pṛcchati", so that, wha..., what is actually
happening is the devotee speakers are sharing their understanding, their
realisations, and how they have internalised, applied, and relished Krishna
Consciousness. And that is what makes the philosophy come alive.

You know, the scripture lives through those who live the scripture. We can study
the scripture at home also. But the scripture as a living reality will become
manifest to any when we associate with those who are living the scripture. That
is why, so when we come, and hear classes, it is not just abstract philosophy
that we are hearing. The philosophy is spoken through devotees who are living,
and realising, and relishing it. And that is how the class has come alive. Now,
if the Bhagavatam class is treated as a ritual, or the class..., weekly
programme that we go to are treated as ritu..., as rituals. Now, the speaker
thinks, oh, I have to go and speak something, and the audience thinks that, oh,
I have go and attend. Then, not, not much of the reciprocation will happen.
Because the heart is not put in that. Only when the heart is put in it, then
there is the joining of both hearts, centered on Krishna.

So, the speakers speak and the audience hears. And the wonderful thing about
bhakti is that the advancement depends on individual sincerity. You know, even,
even if the audience is very inattentive, but the speaker, is speaking
sincerely, diligently, wholeheartedly, when the speaker, by that intense desire
to glorify Krishna to the best of one's capacity, will experience Krishna, will
relish Krishna, and will make spiritual advancement. We see it with Sanjaya.

Sanjaya spoke the whole Bhagavat Gita earnestly to Dhritarashtra.
Dhritarashtra's heart did not change. Dhritarashtra still wanted the fight to go
on. But what happens still? Although his audience was not transformed, what
happens to Sanjaya? Sanjaya goes relishing. Sanjaya in the last two verse,
second, last, 18.76 and 18.77, there is a second last and third last verse of the
Bhagavad Gita, he describes that:

        hṛṣyāmi ca muhur muhuḥ
        ...
        hṛṣyāmi ca punaḥ punaḥ

So, I am relishing it again and again at every moment. I there remember
Krishna's words, I remember Krishna's magnificence without rupah. I am stunned.
I am thrilled he sings. You know, even when there is an intention to glorify
Krishna with sincerity, that itself brings some joy. And even if some speaker is
not very serious, speaker is not very advanced, but if the audience has a
sincere desire to hear and learn, and the audience will get realisation there
also.  Krishna will arrange that. So, of course, if both are sincere, then that
is the best. Then, the reciprocation becomes very rich and very fulfilling. So,
this is how, this is one activity that we do, that we do "guhyam ākhyāti
pṛcchati".

And then there is also "bhuṅkte bhojayate caiva", you know. Srila Prabhupada
would say that whenever we have any programme, you should always have prasad,
even in the early days of the movement, when there was nothing available.
Prabhupada himself was having very little money. Then, Prabhupada would at this,
how, get the apple, and cut the apple. And he would offer one small piece of
pe..., apple to, offer to the apple, to Krishna and then give one small pie...,
slice of apple to everyone. But he said, this principle is make sure you always
have some prasad after the programme. Because prasad is the way, we express
affection.

And, in fact, prasad is the way in which, you know, Krishna enters into the
lives of most people. Krishna enters into their stomach first, and from the
stomach, He works His way into their heart. And He c..., captu... captures them.
So, there is, this is Krishna's transcendental journey through our bodily
anatomy. He enters the stomach. And from the stomach, He moves to the heart. And
many devotees become attracted to Krishna because of prasad. So, this is very
important.

As we know that, Krishna Consciousness is often known as kitchen religion. You
know, Srila Prabhupada's earliest disciple was Kirtanananda. And he was a good
cook. So, Srila Prabhupada called him as kitchenananda. You know, kitchenananda,
he said. So, Prabhupada himself allowed to cook. You know, Hayagriva writes that
in his book The Hare Krishna Explosion, he writes that, when Prabhupada started
cooking, we discovered that he knew so many recipes. He felt as if his knowledge
of cooking the recipes was as vast as his knowledge of sanskrit verses. So, many
recipes, he knew.

There was one time, we asked, Prabhupada, when did you learn this, all this? So,
Prabhupada said, I learnt by observing my mother and asking my mother. So, what
considered a very important part of the culture. He himself cooked. Then he
taught his disciples to cook. And especially, at one time, when Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Thakur's appearance day celebration was there, and at that time, the
devotees said, ok, today is a week day, and not many people will come, so we
will assure that the programme in the evening and then we will have the cooking.
That was what the devotees had planned. But then Prabhupada, as morning
programme got over and then moving, those going to be sl..., Prabhupada was
expecting Puspanjali to be there. So, how is the cooking going? How much are you
cooking? What are you cooking for my spiritual master?

Then the devotees said, Prabhupada, we are not planning now, we are planning in
the evening. Prabhupada said: what? You said that the spiritual master's
appearance is celebrated at noon. That is the way the convention is. And then
Prabhupada himself ran and started cooking. And single-handedly, Prabhupada
cooked dozens of items, just two hours oneself, all high class. And then
Prabhupada himself led the aarti, and he spoke about the spiritual master, and
then he went to his room and took a little prasad and saw how all the devotees
were relishing the feast also. So, Prabhupada considered it that offering the
bhoga on the disa..., on the holy day of his spiritual master as a way
expressing his gratitude. And the gratitude is also one way of affection. So, it
is important. So, this is another thing that happens.

And "dadāti pratigṛhṇāti", how do we do this? Actually, devotees can, should
give gifts. So, for example, on many of the festival programmes. You know, some
people come and give some sponsorship. They may sponsor the prasadam. And then they
have given gifts. So, this is affection. This is reciprocation of affection.
And this reciprocation of affection is what enables people to relish Krishna
Consciousness. Without that, Krishna Consciousness will be very dry. Now, if we
look back, actually, this is our culture itself.

You know, if you look at Sri Caitanya Caritamrta i..., or even if you look back
further to Srimad Bhagavatam, what do we see, that the culture is, when Sudhama
is requested by his wife, please go and ask Krishna for something. So, both of
them feel that if you are going to Krishna, you should give Him something. So,
actually speaking, you know, Sudhama is a small, he is a poverty-stricken
brahmana, and Krishna is the king of Dwarka. You know, whatever Sudhama gives
will be nothing, practically speaking, for Krishna. But still, it is a way of
expressing affection. So, in a sense, it was valueless, for them, it was
extremely valuable. Because they considered it the way they will express
affection. So, the only way they could express affection at that time was,
offering some rice, some flat rice. So, when they took that, rice, and they gave
it. Now, Krishna did not see it just as cheap rice. Krishna saw the affection
over there.

And he relished it once, twice, you know, and, it was, Rupanemi finally stopped
them. You are satisfied, by your taking those, the whole universe has been
satisfied; enough my Lord. So, you know, out of her love for her Lord, she
wanted him to eat the most opulent foods, and she could not tolerate the simple
cheap price Krishna eating. But she also understood that this is Sudhama's
affection be expressed. So, Krishna Himself adored it so much. He saw that,
actually, so, in there, in this, we said "dadāti pratigṛhṇāti" and "bhuṅkte
bhojayate caiva" combined together. You know, for him, Sudhama offered the
chipped rice, and that was eatable item, and which he also offered as a gift.
Now, what did Krishna do in return? "pratigṛhṇāti", Krishna gave him, oh, huge
palace and abundant wealth. And so, we see this reciprocation even among the
Bhagavatam. So, that is how the relationship gets nourished.

Now, if we come to Caitanya Caritamrta, we see repeteadly, this is how Lord
Caitanya actually thickened the relationships between devotees and himself. We
see that Caitanya Mahaprabhu, twenty-four years of his life, he was in Navadvip
perfo..., and almost from the age of twenty, started the harinaam sankirtan,
before that, he was playing the role of a scholar, more or less. Few years more
role more or less, but after he did harinaam sankirtan, from twenty-four to
thirty he traveled around, did preaching. And then, from thirty to fourty-eight,
it seems as if he had stopped preaching only. You know, because he stayed in
Puri, and certainly many great scholars and great devotees came to meet from
there. But he did not go around and preach so much it seems.

So Caitanya Mahaprabhu was a yuga avatar, and had come to teach yuga dharma,
then why is it that he did not teach in the last eighteen years of his life?
Now, ultimately, the Lord has, has His own sweet will and His sweet plan. But we see
what the Lord did, and how that also contribute to preaching in a phenomenal
way. What the Lord did was, he reciprocated love with his devotees, and through
that, he entered into their hearts, and when he entered into their hearts,
through that, he actually perpetuated the Krishna Consciousness movement.
Because they all wanted to please him afterwards. So we see the six Goswamis.
How Caitanya Mahaprabhu had loving exchanges with them. Raghunatha Das Goswami,
when he came and stayed, after be..., after getting away from his family when he
came and stayed in Puri, at that time, Raghunatha Das Goswami would take some
very simple food. All of us know the austerities that he would perform. And Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu took that food, once, and he felt this is sweeter than
nectar for me, this is better than all the bhogas that I have ate, eaten..
Because, in it, was the, was the renunciation of Raghunatha Das Goswami.

Now, of course, devotion was there. But devotion was extended by his
extraordinary renunciation. So, now, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was very pleased
with him. What did he do? He gave him a Govardhana seela, and kunja mala. So
now, that small necklace sort of thing and that small sila stone. Now, from the
material point of view, they were not, they were stone piece, and a small
necklace, it is not of jewels. It is of simple items. That is not, that is not
considered a very precious, or even much valuable. But for Raghunatha Das
Goswami, it was an eternal gift. It was such a previous gift. It was millions of
times more valuable than all the wealth that he had renounced. So, because this
was directly, he felt as if this Govardhan is Krishna, and that, that Kunja Mala
is actually in a sense Radharani. So, the Lord is giving him the divine couple.

So, this was his mood and he felt so grateful to the Lord. So by those acts of
giving that gift, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu entered into the heart of that
devotee. And he stayed in that heart forever and ever. That was how Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu attracted the devotees. And similarly, what did he do to who, Sanatan
Goswami? When Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, when Sanatan Goswami came along the way.
Sanatan Goswami, he got some infection because of contact with some polluted
water. And so, whole body became covered with boyles, which gave out a nasty
pass. So, he wanted to stay with Caitanya Mahaprabhu. But Caitanya Mahaprabhu
has come and embraced him again and again. And in this way, he was showing his
affection to him. And that affection was at once in Sanatan Goswami's heart and
eventually one day, when Sanatan Goswami felt, you know, I am contaminating the
Lord's body, how can I stay here like this? So, he talked with Jagananda Pandit,
and Jagananda Pandit said, yes, you know, Lord has given you New Vri..., a
family in Vrindavan, now, you have stayed, you have seen the Lord, now you
should go back to Vrindavan.

So, when Caitanya Mahaprabhu heard this. Sanatan Goswami said I am planning to
leave my dear Lord. He said. Who has said this? He said Jagananda. So, he said,
who is the Jagananda to give you advice? He said, you are so, so learned, so
advanced that even I can take advice from you. That Jagananda is just a small
word. Who is he to give you advice? So, Sanatan Goswami has had such a loving
affection. Sanatan Goswami said, my dear Lord, you know, those whom we love, we
chastise. And those who are really distant from us, then we respect, very
respectfully deal with them. So he says, you are giving Jagananda Pandit the
nectar of your chastisement, and you are giving me the bitter juice of your
respect and prays. So, Ja..., Ja..., Sanatan Goswami said that Caitanya
Mahaprabhu felt embarassed. And he said, no, no, no, you, I love your very much,
but I cannot tolerate the breach of Vaishnava etiquette. How can such a
Jagananda Pandit give you advice? I love you very much. And Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu came like this and he embraced. And when he embraced him by that,
essentially, Sanatan Goswami's body got mystically cured, became effulgent, and
all the postures, one moment disappeared.

Sanatan Goswami folded his hand, and he said, amazing miracle. And he said, my
dear Lord, what you have done is extraordinary. But I see this whole part of
your lila. It was by your arrangement that I got those boyles, and now by your
merciful arrangement you have removed those boyles. So, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
by his unflinching devotion, his unflinching love for Sanatan Goswami, wandered
in the, one's heart.

Similarly, with Rupa Goswami also. When Rupa Goswami came there to Puri. What
did Caitanya Mahaprabhu do? Caitanya Mahaprabhu one day came along. So, Rupa,
Rupa Goswami, Sanatan Goswami, because they had become muslims earlier, as Dabir
Kas and Sakar Malik, so they considered themselves even navalokas. So, devalokas
were the most exalted among devotees. So, they would stay away from the, others,
away from, a little bit away from the temple, in Siddha Bakula, where Haridas
Thakur was staying. And while they were living over there, at that time, the, 
Caitanya Mahaprabhu would come and meet them. So, one day, Caitanya Mahaprabhu
came, and he saw Rupa Goswami and he had written this verse, tunde tandavini. He
was so pleased, so pleased. Now, generally, you know, there are different levels
of pleasure. And these are also expressed by ways we express it, you know.

Sometimes, when we praise a person, or somebody praises us. You know, that might
just be because of flattery. Right in front of the, you know, this person is
there. I should speak something good about him. It might be flattery. Even if it
is not flattery, it might be obligation. You know, it is a senior person. He is.
So, I have to speak something. But suppose, there is, there is one devotee.
There is, you know, there is this devotee, Krishna, there is one devotee, A, B,
and C. So, if B glories A in front of A. Then, that is, that is good. At least,
we are following the etiquette, and appreciating. But if B glories A in front of
C, that means, I am in front of somebody else. Then, that means that person
really appreciates. And because that person really appreciates, it is, you know,
that was. So, if, if after a class, we go and tell the speaker, that was a very
nice class. That is good, but the speaker is right in front of us, and we are
there, and we are expected to speak something, so we may speak. But after the
class, we go and tell, hey, your today's class, it was so good. This point was
good. This point was good. So, then we appreciate to a third person, then that
is, that means the appreciation is actually very genuine.

So, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu not only spoke this appreciative this "tunde
tandavini" verse, this verse which says that, you know, there are so much nectar
in the holy names. 29:21
