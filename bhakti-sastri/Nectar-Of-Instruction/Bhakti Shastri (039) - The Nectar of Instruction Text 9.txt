Hare Krishna.

Welcome to the Nectar of Instruction class. We are now coming to the last part
of the Nectar of Instruction, the last three texts are there. So, the ninth, tenth,
and eleventh are talking more of glorification. They are not so much of
instruction. Although, instruction is indirectly there. So, the first will talk
about the hierarchy of the various dhamas. That is the ninth text. The tenth
text will talk about the va..., the hierarchy of the various spiritual seekers.
And then the eleventh will combine both the two that the, how, both of them
combined, and that is the highest perfection that a seeker can achieve. So, let
us look at the text here, this ninth text:

        vaikuṇṭhāj janito varā madhu-purī tatrāpi rāsotsavād
        vṛndāraṇyam udāra-pāṇi-ramaṇāt tatrāpi govardhanaḥ
        rādhā-kuṇḍam ihāpi gokula-pateḥ premāmṛtāplāvanāt
        kuryād asya virājato giri-taṭe sevāṁ vivekī na kaḥ

So, "vaikuṇṭhāj janito varā", so "vaikuṇṭhāj" is great, but "varā" is greater
than that, is "madhu-purī". "madhu-purī" is Madhura. Why is Mathura greater?
Because "janito", Lord Krishna was born there. "tatrāpi rāsotsavād", "tatrā",
greater than that even, "āpi" is "rāsotsavād" because of the performance of
rasa-lila, festival of rasa. Greater is " vṛndāraṇyam udāra-pāṇi-ramaṇāt", so
"udāra-pāṇi", so "pāṇi" is hands, "udāra" is ha..., so "udāra" is charitable,
the one person, the person with very charitable hands, who gives benedictions
very f..., freely, very mercifully. And that Lord, "ramaṇāt", keep of, we,
perform the lightful pastimes over there. And "ramaṇāt" especially refers to the
madhuryas pa..., pastime. "tatrāpi govardhanaḥ", so because Krishna performs
the, these intimate pastimes, so "govardhanaḥ" is important.

And "rādhā-kuṇḍam ihāpi gokula-pateḥ", and even higher than "go...",
"govardhanaḥ", is Radhakund because here the Lord of "gokula",
"premāmṛtāplāvanāt", so here there was the nectar of "premā" in which
everybody was flooded, including "gokula-pateḥ", the Lord of "gokula". So, He
was flooded and e..., He flooded all His devotees. So, "kuryād asya virājato
giri-taṭe", so "virājato", means a desiring here, "giri-taṭe", at the foot of
Govardhan. That means near Radhakund, or, on, on Radhakund, at the foot of
Govardhan. "sevāṁ vivekī na kaḥ", so where is that intelligent person, "vivekī"
refers to intelligent person, especially "vivekī" refers to, not just "pudhe",
but it refers to discrimination. The intelligence is to know this is, to know
various things, but "vivekī" means to be able to understand higher and lower, to
discriminate, "vivekī". So, that person who can discriminate, where is that, if
a person can discriminate, where is that person who will not do surrendered
service at Radhakunda. So, in this way, Radhakund is talked about as the
highest of all holy places. Let us look at Srila Prabhupada's translation.

"The holy place known as Mathura is spiritually superior to Vaikuntha, the
transcendental world, because the Lord appeared there. Superior to Mathura -
Puri is the transcendental forest of Vrindavana because of Krsna's rasa-lila
pastimes. And superior to the forest of Vrindavana is Govardhana Hill, for it
was raised by the divine hand of Sri Krsna and was the site of His various
loving pastimes. And, above all, the superexcellent Sri Radha-kunda stands
supreme, for it is overflooded with the ambrosial nectarean prema of the Lord of
Gokula..."

So, Radhakund is overflooded and Radhakund overfloods everyone at it. But:    
    
"... Where, then, is that intelligent person is unwilling to serve this divine
Radha-kunda, which is situated at the foot of Govardhana Hill?"

So, let us look at the purport. So, the hierarchy is something which is
extremely important to understand for us, especially as Gaudiya Vaishnavas. So,
Vaikuntha is, now, Prabhupada basically elaborates on this theme in the purport.
And he explains that Vaikuntha is the spiritual world. That is a transcendental
realm. And it is a tree fourth of total creation. It is superior to the material
world. So, let us look at these concepts first. So, when we look at the concept
of the spiritual world. Some people say this is just a fancy. You know, you
people want to believe that you will not die. And therefore, you imagine the
world that is in..., undestructible. And you will say that, there is, you call
it the spiritual world.

So, people feel that spiritual words is just a fancy. 05:18
