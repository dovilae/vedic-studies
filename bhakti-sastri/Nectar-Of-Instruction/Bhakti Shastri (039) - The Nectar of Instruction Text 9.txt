Hare Krishna.

Welcome to the Nectar of Instruction class. We are now coming to the last part
of the Nectar of Instruction, the last three texts are there. So, the ninth, tenth,
and eleventh are talking more of glorification. They are not so much of
instruction. Although, instruction is indirectly there. So, the first will talk
about the hierarchy of the various dhamas. That is the ninth text. The tenth
text will talk about the va..., the hierarchy of the various spiritual seekers.
And then the eleventh will combine both the two that the, how, both of them
combined, and that is the highest perfection that a seeker can achieve. So, let
us look at the text here, this ninth text:

        vaikuṇṭhāj janito varā madhu-purī tatrāpi rāsotsavād
        vṛndāraṇyam udāra-pāṇi-ramaṇāt tatrāpi govardhanaḥ
        rādhā-kuṇḍam ihāpi gokula-pateḥ premāmṛtāplāvanāt
        kuryād asya virājato giri-taṭe sevāṁ vivekī na kaḥ

So, "vaikuṇṭhāj janito varā", so "vaikuṇṭhāj" is great, but "varā" is greater
than that, is "madhu-purī". "madhu-purī" is Madhura. Why is Mathura greater?
Because "janito", Lord Krishna was born there. "tatrāpi rāsotsavād", "tatrā",
greater than that even, "āpi" is "rāsotsavād" because of the performance of
rasa-lila, festival of rasa. Greater is " vṛndāraṇyam udāra-pāṇi-ramaṇāt", so
"udāra-pāṇi", so "pāṇi" is hands, "udāra" is ha..., so "udāra" is charitable,
the one person, the person with very charitable hands, who gives benedictions
very f..., freely, very mercifully. And that Lord, "ramaṇāt", keep of, we,
perform the lightful pastimes over there. And "ramaṇāt" especially refers to the
madhuryas pa..., pastime. "tatrāpi govardhanaḥ", so because Krishna performs
the, these intimate pastimes, so "govardhanaḥ" is important.

And "rādhā-kuṇḍam ihāpi gokula-pateḥ", and even higher than "go...",
"govardhanaḥ", is Radhakund because here the Lord of "gokula",
"premāmṛtāplāvanāt", so here there was the nectar of "premā" in which
everybody was flooded, including "gokula-pateḥ", the Lord of "gokula". So, He
was flooded and e..., He flooded all His devotees. So, "kuryād asya virājato
giri-taṭe", so "virājato", means a desiring here, "giri-taṭe", at the foot of
Govardhan. That means near Radhakund, or, on, on Radhakund, at the foot of
Govardhan. "sevāṁ vivekī na kaḥ", so where is that intelligent person, "vivekī"
refers to intelligent person, especially "vivekī" refers to, not just "pudhe",
but it refers to discrimination. The intelligence is to know this is, to know
various things, but "vivekī" means to be able to understand higher and lower, to
discriminate, "vivekī". So, that person who can discriminate, where is that, if
a person can discriminate, where is that person who will not do surrendered
service at Radhakunda. So, in this way, Radhakund is talked about as the
highest of all holy places. Let us look at Srila Prabhupada's translation.

"The holy place known as Mathura is spiritually superior to Vaikuntha, the
transcendental world, because the Lord appeared there. Superior to Mathura -
Puri is the transcendental forest of Vrindavana because of Krsna's rasa-lila
pastimes. And superior to the forest of Vrindavana is Govardhana Hill, for it
was raised by the divine hand of Sri Krsna and was the site of His various
loving pastimes. And, above all, the superexcellent Sri Radha-kunda stands
supreme, for it is overflooded with the ambrosial nectarean prema of the Lord of
Gokula..."

So, Radhakund is overflooded and Radhakund overfloods everyone at it. But:    
    
"... Where, then, is that intelligent person is unwilling to serve this divine
Radha-kunda, which is situated at the foot of Govardhana Hill?"

So, let us look at the purport. So, the hierarchy is something which is
extremely important to understand for us, especially as Gaudiya Vaishnavas. So,
Vaikuntha is, now, Prabhupada basically elaborates on this theme in the purport.
And he explains that Vaikuntha is the spiritual world. That is a transcendental
realm. And it is a tree fourth of total creation. It is superior to the material
world. So, let us look at these concepts first. So, when we look at the concept
of the spiritual world. Some people say this is just a fancy. You know, you
people want to believe that you will not die. And therefore, you imagine the
world that is in..., undestructible. And you will say that, there is, you call
it the spiritual world.

So, people feel that the spiritual word is just a fancy. Now, actually speaking,
we will see that, those same people who are sceptical about the spiritual world,
they will turn on their television, and they will watch Disneyland, and they
will watch all kinds of, for example, or Harry Potter is there, and Harry Potter
is normal character and he goes to some magical school and people get so lost in
that magical school. So, what we see over here essentially is that attraction to
the supernatural is natural. People want some extraordinary. People want
something special. People want something which is not stereotype. And basically
the whole material world, it is ultimately the same thing. You know, everywhere,
there is birth, old age, disease, and death. Everywhere, there is eating,
sleeping, mating, defending. Everywhere, there is struggle for existence. So,
just their shapes and forms in which these things are done different. But
essentially, it is the same.

So, people want something new. The same people, now, we, they may see that, they
do not believe that there is some, some actual place called Disneyland. Or there
is no some actual place where Harry Potter lives. You know, it is just for
entertainment. Yes, even if they say it is just for entertainment, but the two
questions. First is, why do they need such a make belief for entertainment? And
second is, why do they take that make belief also seriously? You know, and it is
not just children. When the cartoon shows come up and when these kind of novels
come up, people just read them so eagerly. Why is that?

Nowadays, there is a perverse kind of supernatural. So, there are horror movies.
And there are, there is a very popular genre of fiction is paranormal fiction,
where there are vampires and sometimes there are stories of love affairs between
a vampire and a human being. And now this is all f..., a, from the material
scientific world viewpoint of, f..., point of world, view, it is all
imagination. So, why do people take it so seriously? Because the heart longs for
something beyond the ordinary. So, there are three levels actually. There is the
daily level of existence and because that is so ordinary, we want something
higher, we want something sweeter. But w..., we do not know about God, whe..,
and His kingdom, which is actually higher and sweeter. Or we, even if we know
about it, we dismiss it of as imagination, as mythology, as just fancy. But then
we create our own methodology. We create our own imagination. We create our own
fan..., fancy. We use our own fancy and imagination to create some other places.
And then people just absorb their consciousness in them.

So, now, this sort of obs..., o..., o..., obsession with illusion does not lead
to any transformation. It does not lead to any purification. It does not lead to
any elevation of consciousness. So, the very fact that there is a longing for
something like this, their attraction to the supernatural is natural. So, why is
there attraction like this? That attraction is there because it is natural to
the, us as beings, human beings. And that natural attraction should not be
suppressed, but it should be rightly directed. So, when we dismiss the spiritual
world, and Krishna's supremacy there, and the wonderful things that happen in
the spiritual world as imagination. Then, we, actually, reject reality, and then
we create another imagination, which we actually, for emotional purposes, we
treat as if it is a reality only.

So, instead of mis..., misdirecting our search for the supernatural, we should
direct, understand philosophy and then direct it properly. So, that is the first
point. He said this is universal urge that people want this. And it is not just
o..., ordinary people, even rational people, even intelligent people, they
delight in these things. Why? Because the heart longs for something
supernatural, something wonderful. So, it is an inherent longing in the heart,
and this itself is not a conclusive proof that something is there, which, which
fulfills that longing. But it is an indicator of the possibility that something
can be there, that, beyond that, that is the first point.

Second point is, if we look at the, all the great wisdom traditions of the
world. Now, they all talk about an eternal place. That they may call it kingdom
of God. They may call it Janet. They may call it an, in, as we, in our part, as
we call Vaikuntha. But there are, they all refer to it. And throughout history,
the great wisdom traditions have talked about eternal place, which is our home.
And this world, it is described, is a station. It is a place for a journey. It
is not a place, for, as a destination. So, we are, we are transitory travelers.
And actually we can just be wandering souls or we can be pilgrims on a
pilgrimage. So, the whole process of spirituality is to convert, our disastrous
travel actually. Our travel through material existence is ultimately as a
disasters of old age, disease, anddeath. It is meant to convert our disastrous
travel into a glorious pilgrimage, where we ultimately return to a place, from
where we do not have to return. Where we attain happiness.

Now, universally, it is there. So, first of all, it is universally there in. It
is a universal longing in the human hearts. Secondly, it is expressed in all the
great wisdom traditions of the world. Then, thirdly, it is also talked about in
the scriptures. The scriptures talk about it. Now, even if somebody does not
believe the scriptures or the word of God, but at least, at the basic level, we
see that the people who have studied the scriptures throughout history, they
have been among the wisest peoples. You know, if, whether we look at teology in
so different traditions, or we look at Ramujacharya, Madhavacharya, we look
Baladeva Vidyabushana, Jiva Goswami. You know, if, even if we just look at their
works, we look at the level of scholarship, look at the level of logical
reasoning, and look at the masterful analysis that is there in these books.
Then, we will understand that these are far more than ordinary people. Such
people of..., such extraordinary intellectual caliber. They had talked about
such things, this world, this place called as the spiritual world.

So, it is not something ordinary. It is something that was talked by some of the
most intelligent people in the whole world. And apart from that, when we develop
a little understanding, the basic understanding that we just as all our needs
are provided for by God. You know, the food is provided. Water is provided. Air
is provided. Heat is provided. Light is provided. All our fundamental need for
survival are provided for a, for by God. So, now, if God hhas provided for all
our basic needs, now one important need is knowledge. You know, if somebody
provides us a machine for using, and does not provide a manual or any guide for
how to use the machine. Now, that person would be incomplete in the guidance.
So, now, God has provided for all our needs, but one important need is
knowledge. Will God not provide for that need also? So that need is provided by
through the scriptures which are the revelation of God. And the scriptures, you
know, once we understand that they are manual for life, then we see that they
are actually talking about the spiritual world. And they are saying that that is
the ultimate destination of life. So, once we understand this point, the
spiritual world is ultimate destination of life, then, as per the scriptures,
then all these reasons make us, take this more seriously. And the beyond that,
if we think about the soul. So, the soul, once we understand that, I am not the
body. I am the soul. And this is not very difficult to understand. The body is
just dead matter. And there is nothing in the body that can, nothing in the body
that can actually experience anything. Because it is all dead matter. So, matter
cannot experience matter. There has to be some other experiencer.

And that is consciousness. And that consciousness stays the same in essence even
though the body changes. So, that consciousness is eternal. That is the soul.
So, now, if the soul is eternal, the soul has to be at some place, bel..., we, has
to have some place where it belongs. Nothing in this world is eternal. So, if
the soul is eternal, there must be some place to which the soul belongs, which
is eternal. So, that is how we understand that there is a spiritual world, which
is the original home also. Soul is spirit. So, the spirit soul has to have an
original place. If I come in a particular room, where there is, there are tiles,
and suddenly, on the room floor, I find a gold tablet. That the gold is so
precious, as soon, I, I will pick it up. And one of the most important question
that is coming in my mind is, where did this come from? Now, if somebody is
exploring in a forest, and suddenly somebody finds a gold tablet over there,
then immediately thinks, where is the gold coming? Is there a gold mine from
where this gold has come? So, when we see something incongruous, something which
does not belong to its surrounding in a particular place, that naturally raises
the question, where did this come from? So, once we understand that I am the
atma. And the atma is spiritual. And the atma is eternal. And everything here
around is material and is temporary. Then naturally, the question arises, where
did this atma come from?

And that brings us to the point of the soul, of the spiritual world again. Just
as gold comes from or a gold hole, or gold mind. Similarly, the soul comes from
a place where everything is spiritual. And that is the spiritual world. So, even
from the existence of soul, one can infer the existence of a spiritual world.
And beyond that, there is a lot of scientific research, which has clearly
demonstrated that science with all its advancements has given us tremendous
power, but that power is over a narrow slice of reality. There is much that is
there in this desti..., world, that is beyond the experience of science, or
beyond the reach of science. We know the visible spectrum is tiny in the
electromagnetic spectrum. Similarly, science says that actually first of all
