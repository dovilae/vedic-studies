Hare Krishna.

Welcome to the Nectar of Instruction class. We are now coming to the last part
of the Nectar of Instruction, the last three texts are there. So, the ninth, tenth,
and eleventh are talking more of glorification. They are not so much of
instruction. Although, instruction is indirectly there. So, the first will talk
about the hierarchy of the various dhamas. That is the ninth text. The tenth
text will talk about the va..., the hierarchy of the various spiritual seekers.
And then the eleventh will combine both the two that the, how, both of them
combined, and that is the highest perfection that a seeker can achieve. So, let
us look at the text here, this ninth text:

        vaikuṇṭhāj janito varā madhu-purī tatrāpi rāsotsavād
        vṛndāraṇyam udāra-pāṇi-ramaṇāt tatrāpi govardhanaḥ
        rādhā-kuṇḍam ihāpi gokula-pateḥ premāmṛtāplāvanāt
        kuryād asya virājato giri-taṭe sevāṁ vivekī na kaḥ

So, "vaikuṇṭhāj janito varā", so "vaikuṇṭhāj" is great, but "varā" is greater
than that, is "madhu-purī". "madhu-purī" is Madhura. Why is Mathura greater?
Because "janito", Lord Krishna was born there. "tatrāpi rāsotsavād", "tatrā",
greater than that even, "āpi" is "rāsotsavād" because of the performance of
rasa-lila, festival of rasa. Greater is " vṛndāraṇyam udāra-pāṇi-ramaṇāt", so
"udāra-pāṇi", so "pāṇi" is hands, "udāra" is ha..., so "udāra" is charitable,
the one person, the person with very charitable hands, who gives benedictions
very f..., freely, very mercifully. And that Lord, "ramaṇāt", keep of, we,
perform the lightful pastimes over there. And "ramaṇāt" especially refers to the
madhuryas pa..., pastime. "tatrāpi govardhanaḥ", so because Krishna performs
the, these intimate pastimes, so "govardhanaḥ" is important.

And "rādhā-kuṇḍam ihāpi gokula-pateḥ", and even higher than "go...",
"govardhanaḥ", is Radhakund because here the Lord of "gokula",
"premāmṛtāplāvanāt", so here there was the nectar of "premā" in which
everybody was flooded, including "gokula-pateḥ", the Lord of "gokula". So, He
was flooded and e..., He flooded all His devotees. So, "kuryād asya virājato
giri-taṭe", so "virājato", means a desiring here, "giri-taṭe", at the foot of
Govardhan. That means near Radhakund, or, on, on Radhakund, at the foot of
Govardhan. "sevāṁ vivekī na kaḥ", so where is that intelligent person, "vivekī"
refers to intelligent person, especially "vivekī" refers to, not just "pudhe",
but it refers to discrimination. The intelligence is to know this is, to know
various things, but "vivekī" means to be able to understand higher and lower, to
discriminate, "vivekī". So, that person who can discriminate, where is that, if
a person can discriminate, where is that person who will not do surrendered
service at Radhakunda. So, in this way, Radhakund is talked about as the
highest of all holy places. Let us look at Srila Prabhupada's translation.

"The holy place known as Mathura is spiritually superior to Vaikuntha, the
transcendental world, because the Lord appeared there. Superior to Mathura -
Puri is the transcendental forest of Vrindavana because of Krsna's rasa-lila
pastimes. And superior to the forest of Vrindavana is Govardhana Hill, for it
was raised by the divine hand of Sri Krsna and was the site of His various
loving pastimes. And, above all, the superexcellent Sri Radha-kunda stands
supreme, for it is overflooded with the ambrosial nectarean prema of the Lord of
Gokula..."

So, Radhakund is overflooded and Radhakund overfloods everyone at it. But:    
    
"... Where, then, is that intelligent person is unwilling to serve this divine
Radha-kunda, which is situated at the foot of Govardhana Hill?"

So, let us look at the purport. So, the hierarchy is something which is
extremely important to understand for us, especially as Gaudiya Vaishnavas. So,
Vaikuntha is, now, Prabhupada basically elaborates on this theme in the purport.
And he explains that Vaikuntha is the spiritual world. That is a transcendental
realm. And it is a tree fourth of total creation. It is superior to the material
world. So, let us look at these concepts first. So, when we look at the concept
of the spiritual world. Some people say this is just a fancy. You know, you
people want to believe that you will not die. And therefore, you imagine the
world that is in..., undestructible. And you will say that, there is, you call
it the spiritual world.

So, people feel that the spiritual word is just a fancy. Now, actually speaking,
we will see that, those same people who are sceptical about the spiritual world,
they will turn on their television, and they will watch Disneyland, and they
will watch all kinds of, for example, or Harry Potter is there, and Harry Potter
is normal character and he goes to some magical school and people get so lost in
that magical school. So, what we see over here essentially is that attraction to
the supernatural is natural. People want some extraordinary. People want
something special. People want something which is not stereotype. And basically
the whole material world, it is ultimately the same thing. You know, everywhere,
there is birth, old age, disease, and death. Everywhere, there is eating,
sleeping, mating, defending. Everywhere, there is struggle for existence. So,
just their shapes and forms in which these things are done different. But
essentially, it is the same.

So, people want something new. The same people, now, we, they may see that, they
do not believe that there is some, some actual place called Disneyland. Or there
is no some actual place where Harry Potter lives. You know, it is just for
entertainment. Yes, even if they say it is just for entertainment, but the two
questions. First is, why do they need such a make belief for entertainment? And
second is, why do they take that make belief also seriously? You know, and it is
not just children. When the cartoon shows come up and when these kind of novels
come up, people just read them so eagerly. Why is that?

Nowadays, there is a perverse kind of supernatural. So, there are horror movies.
And there are, there is a very popular genre of fiction is paranormal fiction,
where there are vampires and sometimes there are stories of love affairs between
a vampire and a human being. And now this is all f..., a, from the material
scientific world viewpoint of, f..., point of world, view, it is all
imagination. So, why do people take it so seriously? Because the heart longs for
something beyond the ordinary. So, there are three levels actually. There is the
daily level of existence and because that is so ordinary, we want something
higher, we want something sweeter. But w..., we do not know about God, whe..,
and His kingdom, which is actually higher and sweeter. Or we, even if we know
about it, we dismiss it of as imagination, as mythology, as just fancy. But then
we create our own methodology. We create our own imagination. We create our own
fan..., fancy. We use our own fancy and imagination to create some other places.
And then people just absorb their consciousness in them.

So, now, this sort of obs..., o..., o..., obsession with illusion does not lead
to any transformation. It does not lead to any purification. It does not lead to
any elevation of consciousness. So, the very fact that there is a longing for
something like this, their attraction to the supernatural is natural. So, why is
there attraction like this? That attraction is there because it is natural to
the, us as beings, human beings. And that natural attraction should not be
suppressed, but it should be rightly directed. So, when we dismiss the spiritual
world, and Krishna's supremacy there, and the wonderful things that happen in
the spiritual world as imagination. Then, we, actually, reject reality, and then
we create another imagination, which we actually, for emotional purposes, we
treat as if it is a reality only.

So, instead of mis..., misdirecting our search for the supernatural, we should
direct, understand philosophy and then direct it properly. So, that is the first
point. He said this is universal urge that people want this. And it is not just
o..., ordinary people, even rational people, even intelligent people, they
delight in these things. Why? Because the heart longs for something
supernatural, something wonderful. So, it is an inherent longing in the heart,
and this itself is not a conclusive proof that something is there, which, which
fulfills that longing. But it is an indicator of the possibility that something
can be there, that, beyond that, that is the first point.

Second point is, if we look at the, all the great wisdom traditions of the
world. Now, they all talk about an eternal place. That they may call it kingdom
of God. They may call it Janet. They may call it an, in, as we, in our part, as
we call Vaikuntha. But there are, they all refer to it. And throughout history,
the great wisdom traditions have talked about eternal place, which is our home.
And this world, it is described, is a station. It is a place for a journey. It
is not a place, for, as a destination. So, we are, we are transitory travelers.
And actually we can just be wandering souls or we can be pilgrims on a
pilgrimage. So, the whole process of spirituality is to convert, our disastrous
travel actually. Our travel through material existence is ultimately as a
disasters of old age, disease, anddeath. It is meant to convert our disastrous
travel into a glorious pilgrimage, where we ultimately return to a place, from
where we do not have to return. Where we attain happiness.

Now, universally, it is there. So, first of all, it is universally there in. It
is a universal longing in the human hearts. Secondly, it is expressed in all the
great wisdom traditions of the world. Then, thirdly, it is also talked about in
the scriptures. The scriptures talk about it. Now, even if somebody does not
believe the scriptures or the word of God, but at least, at the basic level, we
see that the people who have studied the scriptures throughout history, they
have been among the wisest peoples. You know, if, whether we look at teology in
so different traditions, or we look at Ramujacharya, Madhavacharya, we look
Baladeva Vidyabushana, Jiva Goswami. You know, if, even if we just look at their
works, we look at the level of scholarship, look at the level of logical
reasoning, and look at the masterful analysis that is there in these books.
Then, we will understand that these are far more than ordinary people. Such
people of..., such extraordinary intellectual caliber. They had talked about
such things, this world, this place called as the spiritual world.

So, it is not something ordinary. It is something that was talked by some of the
most intelligent people in the whole world. And apart from that, when we develop
a little understanding, the basic understanding that we just as all our needs
are provided for by God. You know, the food is provided. Water is provided. Air
is provided. Heat is provided. Light is provided. All our fundamental need for
survival are provided for a, for by God. So, now, if God hhas provided for all
our basic needs, now one important need is knowledge. You know, if somebody
provides us a machine for using, and does not provide a manual or any guide for
how to use the machine. Now, that person would be incomplete in the guidance.
So, now, God has provided for all our needs, but one important need is
knowledge. Will God not provide for that need also? So that need is provided by
through the scriptures which are the revelation of God. And the scriptures, you
know, once we understand that they are manual for life, then we see that they
are actually talking about the spiritual world. And they are saying that that is
the ultimate destination of life. So, once we understand this point, the
spiritual world is ultimate destination of life, then, as per the scriptures,
then all these reasons make us, take this more seriously. And the beyond that,
if we think about the soul. So, the soul, once we understand that, I am not the
body. I am the soul. And this is not very difficult to understand. The body is
just dead matter. And there is nothing in the body that can, nothing in the body
that can actually experience anything. Because it is all dead matter. So, matter
cannot experience matter. There has to be some other experiencer.

And that is consciousness. And that consciousness stays the same in essence even
though the body changes. So, that consciousness is eternal. That is the soul.
So, now, if the soul is eternal, the soul has to be at some place, bel..., we, has
to have some place where it belongs. Nothing in this world is eternal. So, if
the soul is eternal, there must be some place to which the soul belongs, which
is eternal. So, that is how we understand that there is a spiritual world, which
is the original home also. Soul is spirit. So, the spirit soul has to have an
original place. If I come in a particular room, where there is, there are tiles,
and suddenly, on the room floor, I find a gold tablet. That the gold is so
precious, as soon, I, I will pick it up. And one of the most important question
that is coming in my mind is, where did this come from? Now, if somebody is
exploring in a forest, and suddenly somebody finds a gold tablet over there,
then immediately thinks, where is the gold coming? Is there a gold mine from
where this gold has come? So, when we see something incongruous, something which
does not belong to its surrounding in a particular place, that naturally raises
the question, where did this come from? So, once we understand that I am the
atma. And the atma is spiritual. And the atma is eternal. And everything here
around is material and is temporary. Then naturally, the question arises, where
did this atma come from?

And that brings us to the point of the soul, of the spiritual world again. Just
as gold comes from or a gold hole, or gold mind. Similarly, the soul comes from
a place where everything is spiritual. And that is the spiritual world. So, even
from the existence of soul, one can infer the existence of a spiritual world.
And beyond that, there is a lot of scientific research, which has clearly
demonstrated that science with all its advancements has given us tremendous
power, but that power is over a narrow slice of reality. There is much that is
there in this desti..., world, that is beyond the experience of science, or
beyond the reach of science. We know the visible spectrum is tiny in the
electromagnetic spectrum. Similarly, scienctists say that actually, first of
all, our very scale of perception is rema..., limited. And beyond that,
scientists say that it is only parallel universes now. So, if the parallel
universe is axis there, by definition, it is in inaccessible to us.

And there are multiple levels of existence, and we have access to only some of
them. So, this is not just some religious teaching. This is, is, the teaching of
science. Science says that there can be many ways of perception. Many scientists
were pointed this out that actually the scale of perception determines the
perception a lot. You know, if I perceive a person's, even a beaty queen's face
under microscope. Now, there will be no beauty seen over there. All that will be
seen will be some rigids and traps. It will be seen like a mountain area, taken
from a top..., topview area seen through a helicopter. So, there will be traps.
And there will be crest. And there will be valleys. And there will be mountains.
So, the beauty, as we see it at our skill of perception, will not be seen.

Now, if we go deeper and use electron microscope, there will not be seen the
face at all. We will simply see electrons running around. Now, we do not have
any microscope which can show us electrons running around. But if we had, then
we would see something entirely different. So, we have been given a particular
scale of perception, at which we operate. But at other skills of operation,
things will be seen differently. So, there is a too scientific person will
have the humility to admit that there is much in the universe that we do not
know. And the more we have come to know, the more we have realised how little we
know. This is a paradox of science. Sometimes, people think that our knowledge
is increasing. It has increased. But the more we know, what we understand is how
much more there is to know. So, for example, you know, scientists, when they
went to the space. So, human beings conquered space by that. So, that was the,
considered to be a great victory. That proved man's greatness, they say. Ok,
even with prove man's greatness, actually when people went into space, and they
saw from outside the space. What did they see? They saw that universe is so
vast. The earth which seems to be a little gargantuan of land and water when we
are on it, from outer space, the earth seems just like a marble, a tiny marble.
You know, vast universe, where are dangerous missiles shooting by all around.
There are asteroids and meteroids, and all, there are all kinds of dangerous
missiles. So, earth is so tiny, and so vulnerable, just like a tiny marble, a
blueish colored marble.

So, what we understood from that point when, when we had gone out into the space
is that the universe is so big, so big, so big. Therefore, that also is a clear
indication that the universe is far bigger than what we can make categorical
statements about. If somebody is saying that there is no spiritual world. That
is, that is not a scient..., statement that an honest scientist would make.
Honest scientist would say that universe is vast that we do not know what all is
there in it. So, scientists themselves have had to propose concepts like
blackholes, and dark matter, and dark energy, which are imperceivable. So, of
course, these do not directly relate in any way with spiritual world. That
is all within the material world. But the point is that to dismiss anything as
an impossibility, is in..., is indicative and arrogance that is not in a harmony
with the spirit of science. And no honest scientist would, we saw so dismissive.
So, we, we, we can at least be open minded. So, science has itself expanded our
conceptions of what all is there in the universe, and what all is possible, what
all is possible.

So, many of the particles which science has discovered now, say, they have been
considered fantasies hundred years ago. So, those which were considered,
dismalled, even dismissed fantasies, now scientists take those seriously. Why?
Because, it is, progressive scientific research is opening up our minds to show
what all possibilities are there. So, by all this, un..., reasoning, we can
understand that the spiritual is not just a fantasy. It is actually a reality,
and not just the reality. It is the supreme reality. When everything in this
world is destroyed, that parts stay as it is:

        paras tasmat tu bhavo 'nyo
        'vyakto 'vyaktat sanatanah
        yah sa sarvesu bhutesu
        nasyatsu na vinasyati

So "paras tasmat", that beyond this material world, is a spiritual world. When
all in this world is destroyed, that part remains as it is. So, in this way, we
can infer that, actually, all these various lines of reasoning, they are
concurrent, and then they are con..., they are confirmed, they are reinforced by
scriptural revelation. So, we can understand that there is an eternal world. And
that is actually our goal in life. And that abode is where Krishna resides and
from there, and from there, He descends, and from there He sends His
representatives to invite us back to His abode. Now, when we talk about the
spiritual world, Prabhupada explains that this material world is "ekapad
vibhuti", the spiritual world is "tripad vibhuti", so, it is, it is three times
the material, mate..., spiritual world. The spiritual world is three times the
material world. Now, this may raise a question for us. I..., is the material, is
the spiritual world finite or infinite? And if the spiritual world is infinite,
then how can we quantify it? How can we say that, this is, if spiritual world is
infinite, and it is three times the material world, then is material world also
infinite? Because it is one third. So, one third of infinity, is that also
infinity? We, when we come to this, there is, there is an important principle to
understand. You know, although there is infinity, there are also levels of
infinity. What does levels of infinity mean? You know, for example, if we say
that there is a, the whole set of natural numbers, one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, that is infinite. You know, if I take those whole set of, o..., the
set, the complete set of odd numbers, one, three, five, seven, nine, that is
also infinite. Now, intuitively, I understand that, although both are infinite,
there is a difference. You know, this inf..., the infinite se..., set of all odd
numbers is contained within the infinite set of all natural numbers. Now, if I
take the set of all prime numbers, one, three, five, seven, eleven, thirteen,
seventeen, nineteen, like that, twenty-three, so then this is also infinite, but
this is contained further within the natural set, and it is smaller than the set
of all odd numbers.

So, the, in mathematics, we have to understand that when we come to infinity, we
cannot really apply our logic. So, there are possibilities. So, the point is,
the spiritual world is infinite. And the material world, "ananta koti brahmanda
nayaka", it is said. Lord Vishnu is the creator of innumerable material worlds.
This innumerable means that there are so many that they cannot be counted. So,
the basic point of this comparison is to emphasize that the spiritual world is
far far greater, far far grander, far far more wonderful than the material
world. And tha..., that is that spiritual world which is our ultimate
destination.

So, now, in the spiritual world, why is it superior to the material world? It is
Vaikuntha. Kuntha means anxiety. Vaikuntha means, vai means without, so without
any anxiety. So, it is all without anxiety. It is completely perfect that is
eternal happiness over there. So, there is eternal existence, eternal happiness
over there. And that is why, that is the so, cherished aspiration of all the
wise souls. They all want go back there. "ma upeta konde puna manjana vijayate".
Krishna says:

        duhkhalayam asasvatam
        napnuvanti mahatmanah
        samsiddhim paramam gatah

So, those who understand this is "duhkhalayam asasvatam", they attain that abode
and then they never come back. Once they worship me, they attain that abode and
they never come back here. As they worship me, they attain that abode and they
never come back here. So, now, when we talk about the spiritual world, are there
hierarchies in the spiritual world? Yes, when we say the hierarchy, again, we
have to be very careful. See, the hierarchy concept in the spiritual world has
to be understood in terms of rasa, in terms of tattva. The whole spiritual world
is eternal. Whole spiritual world is the kingdom of God. And everybody in the
spiritual world is a liberated soul.  aBecause everybody in the spiritual world
is a liberated soul. Thereore, everybody there is perfect. And everybody there
is happy. It is not that, some, you know, the Go..., when we say Goloka
Vrindavan is higher than Vaikuntha, or as this verse says that Mathura is higher
than Vaikuntha. Now, that does not mean that Vaikuntha's residences are
miserable and they are thinking that, oh, if you go to Gol..., Go..., Vaikuntha,
go to Mathura, it is so nice. See, from the point of tattva, they are all
perfect. What we are talking here is in terms of rasa.

You know, for Hanumanji, Lord Rama's worship is a perfection of his life. He
wants to serve Lord Rama and does not want to do anything else. He is not
thinking, oh, oh, oh, Krishna is higher than Rama, so I want to serve of
Krishna. No. He is completely satisfied. So, for him, in terms of rasa, it is
completely satisfied in serving Lord Rama. And that is how it tastes for all
devotees in the spiritual world. The Vai..., in the Vaikuntha also, the devotees
are perfect. You know, this says there is a hierarchy described by Rupa Goswami
in this verse. The same hierarchy, a similar hierarchy is told through a story
by Sanatan Goswami through his Brihad Bhagavatamrta. And in that Brihad
Bhagavatamrta, he describes how this Gopa Kumar, Gopa Kumar is a seeker, and he,
he is attracted to blue cowherd, bluish cowherd boy. And he goes to various
great people in this world, and ultimately, he meets his spiritual master, gets
a mantra, and then becomes attracted to Supreme Lord. When he is attracted to
Supreme Lord, then by chanting the mantra, by getting purified, he actually goes
to the spiritual world. He reaches to the spiritual world. He reaches to
Vaikuntha.

So, in Vaikuntha, he finds that, actually, he is a..., he is happy to see the
Lord worshipped in opulence, and he feels grateful that he is there. But after
some time over there, he starts feeling restless. He starts feeling restless. He
feels, you know, I wanted, I want, I want to, I am not satisfied here. I want to
go to a blue co..., see a blue cowherd boy. And then by the arrangement of Lord,
from there, also he comes back here to the material world. And he comes to
Goloka Vrindavan, and, you know, there is Goloka Vrindavan in spiritual world,
there is, you could call it Boloka Vrindavan, what is manifested over here, in
this world, and from here, it is sadhana, vraja bhakti, and then he goes to the
spiritual world again.

So, the point of this is that when he goes to s..., Vaikuntha, and comes back,
so he is not satisfied in Vaikuntha, but the other Vaikuntha vasis, they are
satisfied. And they are worshipping Lord Vishnu. And they are satisfied in the
worship of Lord Vishnu. They do not think, oh, we want to see somebody else. And
they actually consider the Vishnu to be the Supreme. You know, the, for them,
Lord Vishnu is the me all and the end all. And that is accepted. Rupa Goswami
does not, Sanatan Goswami does not say there is anything wrong with that. He
accepted fully. Why? Because we have to understand that in the transcendental
realm, when it comes to rasa, one ser..., one person's rasa cannot be imposed on
another. So, from the rasa point of view, the Vai..., the way Vaikuntha vasi
sees, Vaikuntha' isperfection on Lord Vishnu. Worshipping majestic form is the
perfection their life. They do not want anything higher. They are satisfied with
that.

So, similarly, different devotees can be in different rasas and they are all
satisfied. But in terms of the swe..., intimacy and the sweetness of the
pastimes, Krishna's pastimes are, say, more intimate and, and sweeter than the
pastimes of Vishnu. So, that is in terms of rasa, if we see it from a point of
view of objectivity. Yes. Kri..., now, Lo..., Vishnu does not have a father.
Krishna has a father and a mother. And then the vatsala rasa is very intimate.
So, this way, we understand that there is the objective way, we, in which we can
understand, and this is higher. But when we talk about objective, with that does
not say that subjective is all wrong. The.., there is room for transcendental
subjectivity. And in spiritual world, there can be many bests. So, Vaikuntha is
also the best. But at the same time, for the devotees who are in Vaikuntha, it
is the best. But for those who are seeking after Krishna, then Krishnaloka is
the best.

So, we are in the Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya. And Rupa Goswami is giving us
the Gaudiya Vaishnava siddhanta. And that Gaudiya Vaishnava si.., siddhanta is
not just subjective. There is some objective reasoning also for saying how the,
how and why, Goloka Vrindavan and as is discussed over here, Radhakunda is the
highest. So, we should not impose our rasa on others. At the same time, we
should not just say that everything is same. Everything is perfect. But at the
same time, there are levels of perfection. Prabhupada writes in the purport
that, Radhakunda may not be considered to be the highest by those belong, those
who are not in Gaudiya Sampradaya. That is fine. If they are not in Gaudiya
Sampradaya, they may not accept it. But we do not have to, we do not have to
ourselves becomes insecure, oh, why are they not accepting it. Nor do we have to
think that they have to accept it. We, I have to impose it on them. No. We do
not have to do that. Caitanya Mahaprabhu, when he went to South India, you know,
when he saw a devotee worshipping Lord Rama, so devotely, a Rama bhakta, that he
was feeling agony thinking that, oh, Rama ha..., that Rama's consort, the
goddess of fortune, Sita had been touched and abducted by Ravana. He was so
bereaved, he was so distressed by that, that he could not do anything. Here, he
invited Caitanya Mahaprabhu to his house. But he could not cook food also. So,
so distressed because of that.

When Caitanya Mahaprabhu saw that, Caitanya Mahaprabhu did not tell him, forget
Rama, worship Krishna. Caitanya Mahaprabhu actually appreciated his sentiments.
And after appreciating his sentiments, he later on find a, found a scripture,
in which, there was a reference to how Lord Rama, was, Lord Rama's consort,
Sita, was never touched by Ravana. It was only maya Sita who was taken away. And
he came back and gave that to this devotee. And that devotee became very
enlivened by this. So, here, we see that the Lord was so caring. The Lord did
not try to impose. The Lord was not ins..., Lord was not in a sense trying to
just convert everyone to Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Yes. Those who were not, were not
so devoted to a particular thing, they were just devoted to Supreme Lord. In
some cases, he elevated them to higher rasa. But that is f..., that is fine. So,
the point is the Lord allowed people to practice according to their rasa also.
So, what that indicates is, that we should not hier..., use this hierarchy to
thrust down things on others. But still, we have to cherish what we have been
given in the Gaudiya Vai..., the Gau..., Gaudiya Sampradaya.

So, now, after understanding these basics, let us move to the next one, Mathura.
So, now what happens in Mathura is, 31:52
