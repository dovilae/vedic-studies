Hare Krishna.

Welcome back to the Nectar of Instruction. We are discussing text four, and
among the six elements of text four, "dadāti pratigṛhṇāti", and "bhuṅkte
bhojayate caiva", these are the four that we have discussed. Now, we will
discuss "guhyam ākhyāti pṛcchati". that we, how we reveal our heart in
confidence and share our heart with confidence.

This is actually one of the most important aspects of devotional service. And
ths will determine whether we will have deep relationships or superficial
relationships. So, we will discuss what it means to share our heart in
confidence. The sharing of the heart can be at multiple levels. At the level of
pure devotional service, at very advanced level of devotional service, both the
devotees' hearts are wedded to Krishna. And naturally they talk about Krishna.

So, we see this, you know, for example in the Caitanya Cairtamrta, when Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu would be with his intimate associates, Swarup Damodar
Goswami and Ramananda Ray. These were his two most intimate associates in the,
in the Gambhira, that was his place, in Jagannath Puri. And they would discuss
very confidential pastimes of Krishna. And they would sing verses, recite verses
on the Bhagavatam, sing songs and Caitanya Mahaprabhu would be in ecstasy.

So, this is a very intimate sharing of the heart. And that is the ultimate goal
of all devotees. If you want to:

        mac-cittā mad-gata-prāṇā
        bodhayantaḥ parasparam
        kathayantaś ca māṁ nityaṁ
        tuṣyanti ca ramanti ca

That:

        bodhayantaḥ parasparam
        kathayantaś ca māṁ nityaṁ

That we talk to each other about Krishna, and in that, we relish the supreme
happiness. In fact, it is said in the Bhagavatam that "parasparam kathayantaś",
that the joy of discussing Krishna Katha with every intimate devotee, it is the
highest pleasure that two human beings can have. At a material level, two people
come together, the highest pleasure that they can have is the pleasure of
ordinary relationship, sex. But higher than that is the pleasure when two human
beings come together as devotees, and discuss intimately about the common object
of their love. It is Krishna.

So, this is what we aspire for. Now, like-minded devotees come together, and
very intimately discuss about Krishna. So, we see this again and again in the
Caitanya Caritamrta. Isvara Puri did this kind of service for Madhavendra Puri,
not only did he take care of his body, but also he very intimately served his
spiritual master by speaking about Krishna at tho..., in his final days. So,
that is at the highest level, where in my heart, Krishna is there, and another
heart, another devotee's heart, Krishna is there, both of us come together, we
intimately discuss Krishna.

So, this is also what we do when we come together officially in classes. But it
may not be so much that in my heart Krishna is there. It may be that Krishna is
primarily in my head, little bit in my heart also. And in the case of the
audience also, little bit in their head, little, little bit in their heart. And
we try to intellectually understand, and relate, and try to develop our
relationship with Krishna in whatever way we can.

So, that is also quite nourishing for the heart. Because we are discussing about
Krishna. Anything centered on Krishna is good. So, at one level is, two devotees
discussing Krishna intimately. At another level is, two devotees discussing
their service to Krishna. So, the two are not necessarily different, but in some
cases, do, they do become different.

Now, for example Draupadi, and the queens of Dwarka, when they met together.
Then the queens of Dwarka asked Draupadi. You know, how do you serve your
husbands? You know, you have, you are one wife and you have five husbands. You
know, we are, we are so many and we all have to serve one husband. So we are in
a different predicament, but our service is the same. Please tell us how do you
serve. And then in Mahabharat, it is described, Draupadi tells, you know, how
she is the first to wake, she is last to rest, and she never ea..., she serves
all her husbands dutifully, she ensures that they all take food before she
takes. And she gives a lot of variety of ways in which she serves. And seeing
the sincerity with which she serves her husbands, all the queens of Dwarka, they
are very im..., impressed and inspired.

Now, in a sense, we could say in the hierarchy, Dwarka wasis are higher than
Hastinapur wasis. Dwarka wasis are considered more intimate associates. Dwarka
is a part of the spiritual world directly. So, but they have no hot inners that
we are superior to you. When they come together, they learn from each other how
can we serve better. So, similarly, when two devotees come together, then they
can learn, they can talk about their services. For example, there are two book
distributors who come together, and they share their experiences. Oh, you know,
while we were book distrbuting, we did like this, we did like this. This is
what happened. Or two people who have constructed temples in different places,
they come together. So service brings us together.

And then, because of services are inherent to Krishna, the talks are also
connected with Krishna, they focus on service to Krishna. So, now, Srila
Prabhupada would often say, when he would discuss about Krishna Conciousness, he
would either talk philosophy or many disciples would come to talk about the
services. You know, his, his way of interacting with his disciples when you, if
we see when he goes on morning walks, most of his morning walks, he would be
talking philosophy. And the morning walks emerged spontaneously. They emerged
spontaneously means that one day Srila Prabhupada said I want to go on morning
walk, those who want can come with me. And when they started going, they found
that Prabhupada was in a different mood, quite relaxed, observing nature, and
making some comments based on nature. And the devotees, they started seeing the
whole world with new eyes because of Prabhupada's Krishna Consciousness.

And this became among the most loved of all of Prabhupada's events. Now,
Prabhupada's classes were there when he was the acharya speaking formally. Srila
Prabhupada was the acharya even when he wanted to go on a morning walk, but the
mood was more intimate, more sweeter, Srila Prabhupada was equally intructive,
but much more relaxed, much more approachable in a sense. Devotees coud ask him
questions, and he would answer. And he would look at nature and by, from obvious
facts, he would derive extraordinary insights. And, so that was Srila Prabhupada
talking in the first level. "guhyam ākhyāti pṛcchati". Prabhupada was showing
the devotees, Krishna, in nature, in the world, in the things that we day to day
see, but we do not see their Krishna connection.

Then Srila Prabhupada, when devotees would come, 07:13
