Hare Krishna.

Welcome to the Nectar of Instruction. We are discussing the first, second verse
now. The first verse we will complete and then we will go to the second verse
if possible today.

The first verse, what we are discussing is the six vegas.

        vāco vegaṁ manasaḥ krodha-vegaṁ
        jihvā-vegam udaropastha-vegam
        etān vegān yo viṣaheta dhīraḥ
        sarvām apīmāṁ pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt

So, we were discussing first about atonement. There is a direct method, there is
a, the traditional method of cultivation of qualities for purification. And then
there is the pancaratra method, the devotional method, centered on practicing
bhakti yoga. And in that, we discussed about "vaco", "manasah", and
"krodha-vegan", based on Srila Prabhupada's commentary. We will complete that,
the remaining three vegas, and then we will look at what Srila Prabhupada says
based on Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur's commentary. Let us look at the PPT
here.

So we have "jihva" and "Udaro Pastha" vega. So in "jihva" vega, the urge of the
tongue. Now this is to eat. "vaco vegam" refers to the urge of the tongue to
speak. Now "jihva vegam", Srila Prabhupada says that actually people are
controlled by their tongue and they are running here and there becauase of that.
So people are forced to eat in non-devotee shops. Even devotees, and the
solution is prasad. And then, the solution has two parts, be grateful when
Krishna supplies, accept as mercy, and take at scheduled times. Let us look at
this a little bit more in detail.

Now, today, many people are committing suicide with their tongue. The way they
are eating, they are inviting that, not just in terms of the kinds of food that
they eat. That is definitely there, but also the quantites of food that they
eat.

As an old egyptian probably (?, 02:23) says that, now you live on one third what
you eat, the remaining two third lives your physician. So this is all the more
true in today's society, where obesity is fast becoming one of the most
widespread causes of avoidable disease, disease, not just, disease, but even
death. So this, of course, is a combination jihva and udar vega. Srila
Prabhupada does not talk too much about udar vega. The two are connected. So
what is the essential difference?

Jihva vega refers to the taste. You know, we want to eat a lot of variety of
objects that are delicious. And udar vega refers to the quantity. Now, we want
to eat it more than what we, our body needs. So, of course, where the is desire
to eat variety of food stuffs, then that jihva vega lead, will lead to udar vega
also. So the point is not to have a hairsplitting analyses between the two. The
point is to understand the underlying common principle of controlling the urge
of the tongue.

Now, jihva vega today is especially difficult to control in today's culture
because in the past, food was primarily given as charity, and even when food was
sold as a commodity, it was never marketed as agressively as it was today.
Although people throughout history have eaten delicious foods, according to their
culture, according to social situations, but the sheer amount of marketing that
happens today is historically unprecedented. And because of that, people are
caught in a cultural bind actually. The cultural bind is, because our society
often looks down at people who are obese. Now, people who are fat, the whole
society is moved, idea is to look good, to look smart, and generally, smart
looks are equated with thin looks.

So a person who is obese is almost treated like a "pare barya", is a, is like a,
like an untouchable, or a visually untouchable, unseeable person. Such a person
actually, people, just to try to avoid looking fat, do all sorts of things. They
do bariatric surgeries, they often undergo anorexia, they do not eat food
properly. So on one side, people have uncontrolled tongues which are further
fueled by the external propaganda, which makes them want to eat more and more
and more, and on the other side there is the cultural glamorisation of the thin
figure, which prevents people from eating, and both ways, people want both, want
to have a thin good looking figure, and they also want to have, enjoy the
tongue's delights, which the tongue is also pulling them and externally also the
culture is glamorising various foods.

So it is a, it is a torturous situation and generally, it is damn if you do it,
damn if you do not do it. So damn if you do not eat, because the mind will keep
torturing the senses, tongue will keep torturing, if you do it, then we become
mre weight and we face problems because of that. So either way, the point is
that we have to raise to a higher level of consciousness. Just trying to control
the senses at the same material level of consciousness, it is nearly impossible.
It is like playing a game that we cannot win, and we cannot quit.

Imagine there is a huge boxer, fighting with a thin skinny person, who neither
has strength, nor has skill to fight. And the person, the people are in the
same ring. So, this poor fellow gets beaten again, again, and again. And if
there is a rule that there is no matter how badly this fellow gets beaten, not
allowed to quit the ring. So, what happens? Cannot win, there is just no chance
of winning. But cannot quit, so just get beaten, beaten, beaten, beaten, so that
is the predicament at the material level of consciousness. 

Now, on one level, we are faced with so many desires, and most material desires,
they have these characteristics. They are insatiable and they are irresistible.
Irresistible means we just cannot say no to them. At least at the material level
of consciousness also, it is almost impossible to say no to that. Because we are
living for material enjoyment only, so they are irresistible. And then they are
insatible. That means if I try to satisfy them, they do not get satisfied. They
blaze further and become bigger, and then I become trapped further.

So, this is the two-way bind, insatiability and irresistibility. Insatiability
means we cannot win the game. Irresistibility means we cannot quit the game.
So, we cannot win the game means, even if we satisfy those desires, even if we
get those enjoyments, we do not win, because those desires blaze further and
they want us to get more and more and more, so it is insatiable. And
irresistible means if you say, I will not just bother about the all, just not
bother about this desire, does not work. Because the desires keep haunting,
goading us, biting us from inside, do this, do this, get this, enjoy this.

So that is the sorry predicament that we find ourselves in. And this is not just
a predicament for devotees. Earlier, I talked about, you know, wanting to eat
and enjoy, and wanting to have a good figure and enjoy. That is a predicament
which even non-devotees, even general people face this. And also, beyond that,
there is also the whole point that even materialistic people cannot fulfill all
the desires that are there in their mind. How can they? Because the body is
limited, the resources are limited, the life span is limited, they cannot
fulfill all the desires. So they also have to hard live with unfulfilled
desires and that also causes anguish to them. So the torture is there for
everyone at the material level of consciousness, no matter what happens,
everybody has to struggle and suffer.

Now, when we talk about controlling the tongue, what does it mean? There is one
level of control, that is for looking good. You know, some people fast. There
are many, there are diets for reducing one's weight, are very popular. And there
all kinds of, sometimes crazy diets. Sometimes, there is one, one particular diet
which has become popular because of the advocacy of one doctor, one particular
set of doctors, although other doctors are militantly opposed, they say that
just gorge on one day, and fast on the next day. That means one day eat whatever
you like, whatever you like, just fulfill all your heart's desire. And on the
next day, just take some soup, take some soybean, salad, eat nothing,
practically speaking.

And they say that overall the body is, if you gorge on one day, and fast on the
next day, then overall the body's balance will be such that actually you will
lose weight. Now, first of all, it is very unlikely that the body will lose
weight, but even if that happens, that does not suit the body's biochemical
mechanism. The body just does not know what is going to happen. How am I
supposed to adapt? The body has its own clock and its own system. And it is very
physically and psychologically hazardous.

So people are desperate, which is to, at one side, satisfy the tongue and at
the same time not pay the cost for satisfying the tongue. And because of that,
they are in a trap. So fasting is often adopted by people as a means to decrease
their weight. And some people may be, seem to be very controlling their tongue,
very selecting in their eating. Now, to the extent the person has self-control,
that is appreciable, but just self-control in and of itself is not necessarily a
sign of spiritual advancement. You know, Hiranyakasipu had self-control, but he
was spiritually most regressed, not at all advanced. His whole motive was not at all
devotional. It was entirely anti-devotional, to defy Lord Vishnu, disrupt the
order of Lord Vishnu, and eventually provoke and destroy Lord Vishnu.

So, just the ability to control the tongue, in and of itself is not necessarily
spiritual. Although it is valuable, we could say when essential for making steady
spiritual advancement. But it is not, we should not glorify it as a separate
virtue. But the whole process of devotional service is such that as we go along
the express way of devotional service, the senses automatically get regulated.

So when we take prasad, at that time, we learn to control the tongue. Because
prasad itself circumscribes, it limits the kinds of food that we will get. So
that itself is a major level of sense-control. Because, people, there are so
many allurements for the tongue, and if we decide, I am going to take prasad,
then that limits the varities available for our tongue to titillate itself.

Of course, once we get adapted to those limitations, within those limitations,
prasad also offers us nearly, nearly endless allurements, and as sadhakas, you
know, we also need enjoyment. We need enjoyment even at the material level, and
that is not banned. Bhakti provides us material enjoyment that is within the
principles of dharma. So taking prasadam, feasting on prasadam is not
necessarily against the principles of devotion. But making a habit of that, and
become attached to that, and becoming emotionally dependent on opulent prasadam, 
sumptuous prasadam on a regular basis, can be a serious problem.

Why serious problem? Because, you know, although Krishna prasad is also Krishna,
the question is not whether it is Krishna or not, the question is whether it
reminds us of Krishna or not. So if we are not remembering Krishna when we are
eating Krishna prasad, we are just remembering it as food, as delicious food,
then of course, at a subconscious level, because it has been offered to Krishna,
it will purify us. But at the conscious level, we will not be remembering
Krishna, and at the physical level, because of overeating, inappropriate eating,
there will be physical consequences.

So the manifestations of Krishna, when they come in this world, they generally,
they act at the transcendental level to purify us, but at a material level, they
act like other material substances. So, the deity needs to be cleaned, the
deity, if it has fly, then the deity, the fly has to be moved away. The deity is
transcendental, but at the same time the transcendence is not in some miraculous
potency to do something which is not done, by, normally. But miraculous potency
is in the purification of the hearts, so prasadam will purify our heart.

At the same time, while it will purify us, a lot of the purification will depend
on our consciousness. Our consciousness, if it is just seeing prasad materially,
then there will be inevitably limited consequences of the way we eat prasad, and
the way it jells or does not jell with our body, but along with that depending
on the rememberance of Krishna, the purification will be maximum or minimum.

So Srila Prabhupada talks in the purport about how we have to be careful about
what we eat, how we eat. If you are not careful, then we can get entangled. So,
now, generally prasad is, a temptation that is entirely within the precincts of
devotional service. And we see Caitanya Mahaprabhu feasted with his devotees.
And then he would often invite the devotees to eat more and more. So, arse the
culture of prasadam. So that is wonderful. And we can take prasadam.

At the same time, overall, Caitanya Mahaprabhu has also said, Srila Prabhupada
quotes in the purport, "balana kayber balana perime". That do not eat opulently,
do not dress opulently. So, on a habitual basis, having opulent prasadam is
undesirable. And feast on special occasions, having opulent prasadam is ok.

There, there also, the more we see prasad as Krishna's mercy, to that, to that
extent, we will become purified. Now, Srila Prabhupada in tapsa would also talk
about fasting. You know, you talk about fasting on ekadashi, and fasting on
Janmashtami and other festivals. So why is this fasting important? Fasting is
not just something which is meant to torture the body. Kulusekar Maharaj says in
his Mukunda-mala-strota that "medas-cheda-phalan afgaha nanani", he says if a
person fasts, then the purpose of fasting, if one is not remembering Krishna
while fasting, then "medas-cheda-phalan". So what he says is that fasting is
simply a fat reducing exercise. It does not lead to much spiritual benefit if we
are not remembering Krishna.

If we are remembering Krishna, then fasting provides us an opportunity to
sacrifice the good for the best. What does it mean, sacrifice the good for the
best? See, there is the bad, there is the good and there is the best. The bad is
paap, the good is prunya, but the best is bhakti. Best is Krishna. So prasad is
of course not prunya. Prasad is a part of bhakti only, but still as I said,
prasad has a material aspect to it also which can distract us from Krishna
Consciousness.

So normally, when we practice spiritual life, we have, we give up sinful
activities. We sacrifice the bad for the sake of Krishna. But along with that,
sometimes the good can also attract us and distract us from rememberance of
Krishna. So that is why sacrificing the good for the sake of the best is also
a way to show singlepointed focus on Krishna. So often, our desires gets plead
over a variety of things.

        bahu-sakha hy anantas ca
        buddhayo 'vyavasayinam

In 2.41 in the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna says that "bahu-sakha", many branches
are there for our desires, and then to emphasize he "anantas ca", he says there
are not just "bahu" many, but there are "ananta" innumerable.

So our power to desire gets plead over many objects in this world. And that is
why the strength of our desire for Krishna is not very high. So when we fast,
what is the purpose of that fasting? You know, our desires that have been
dissipated over various things. You know, we just bring all those desires,
concentrate them on Krishna. So much, oh Krishna, do I desire you, more than
food, more than water, more than sleep. I cannot do it throughout my life, but I
can do it at least on special days.

So for us, fasting is a way of showing Krishna the intensity of our longing for
Him. So if we are fasting and thinking of food, then we will not make much
spiritual advancement. In fact, we will torture ourselves by fasting. Or if we,
we are able to fast, then we will become proud of that fasting. You know, if we
are fasting, and then looking at who all is eating what, and thinking, and these
people have no control over the senses, just see how much they are eating. Then,
our body is fasting, but our ego is feasting. And that will not lead to any
spiritual advancement, practically speaking.

But even if that does not happen, so our fasting should not be our ego's feat.
It should be our devotion's fruit. Not our ego's feat means, yes, I can do this,
based on that if you fast, then there is not much spiritual advancement. But
devotion's fruit means that when the, when we decide to fast, our primary focus
is that we do not want to distract our time, and most importantly our thoughts
over desires away from Krishna to anything else at that time. So the purpose of
fasting is to concentrate our desires primarily and possibly, exclusively on
Krishna, at least during the duration of the fast.

So when the hunger starts tormenting us, at that time, if we turn our thoughts
towards Krishna, and fix the thoughts on Krishna, then the rememberance of
Krishna gives us a non-material nourishment. That helps us to trasncend the
torment of hunger. That is what Pariksit Maharaja tells Sukadeva Goswami that do
not think that I am ksut..., I am troubled by hunger. Why? Because I am drinking
the nectar of Krishna Katha from your ears.

So when we are remembering Krishna, then that gives us a non-material
nourishment that minimizes the torment created by the lack of physical
nourishment. And in this way, we experience the reality of the higher happiness
of Krishna Consciousness. See, the higher happiness of Krishna Consciousness
depends on the focus of our consciousness in Krishna. If we are not conscious of
Krishna, we cannot experience the happiness of Krishna Consciousness.

So fasting forces us to become conscious of Krishna because if we are not
conscious of Krishna, then immediately, we become conscious of the hungry
stomach, and that starts tormenting us. So that is why fasting is not just a
physical austerity. It can be a devotional austerity. It can be an
intensification of our devotional advancement, of devotional consciousness, if
it is done properly. So, the occasion, say, like ekadashi, which is normally
there, you know, as devotees, we can try as much as possible to utilise the
opportunity for fasting on ekadashi.

Different devotees fast at different levels. Some devotees fast nirjala. Now,
nirjala fasting is difficult for many devotees and often it is also not so good
for health, even according to ayurvedic doctors because just the body's whole
cyclic system stops, because there is no flood in it. So, fasting with water is
also reco, actually the recommended for its health benefit also. Because it
allows the body to cleanse itself. When the body is not forced to take in new
food constantly and digest it and process it, then the body gets time to
recover, recoup and do some pending work. Just like a machine needs rest, so
that it can function better, similarly the body needs rest.

Digesting mechanism, the metabolic mechanism of the body, if it gets rest from
continuous inflow of new ener..., new food to digest, and process, then it can
work to cleanse itself internally, and heal itself internally. So fasting has a
lot of medical benefits also. In ayurveda, they say "Langanam Parama Oushadam",
that fasting is, is among the best of medicines.

So, the flood fas..., water fasting or flood fasting, taking some juices, eleven
water or fruit. That is one level. So, nirjala fasting is one level. One level,
next to that is water fasting, then one level next to that is some juice fasting.
That below that is just fruit fasting. Below that is taking raw foods, fruits,
vegetables like that. And other stage below that is taking no grains, but only
once a day, or taking twice a day, then taking thrice a day. Now, many devotees
actually on ekadashi, they just consider that, the only fasting is that I will
not take grains on that day. Now, we are missing out on the potential benefits
that we can get from ekadashi, by considering ekadashi to be just a day when we
restrict the choice of the diet, and not restrict the quantity and the frequency
of the diet.

So, ekadashi can help us to go deeper into our Krishna Consciousness. Of
course, we can say that more important than fasting is chanting extra, and
remembering Krishna, extra. Yes, but the physical restriction decreases the
distraction by which we are able to focus the mind on Krishna. Now, of course,
if we find ourselves physically unsuited for fasting, then it is not necessary
to fast. The important point is to practice devotional service. If somebody says
I will fast, but I will sleep all day, then it is better to stay awake, remember
Krishna, serve Krishna and take food whatever is required.

So, fasting should not become another God for us. That means another object of
thought. Our fasting should be a means by which our thoughts get redirected from
food to Krishna. But there is, so what? Jihva vegam can be controlled very
powerfully by fasting on the occasions which the scriptures anyway take, give us
as sacred.

So, Srila Prabhupada writes that when we eat food also, then if we are selective,
oh, this food is delicious, I want to take that, then we are again not seeing
things spiritually. So, if we go to a person's place because that person is
going to give very nice food, then nice prasad, then we are actually succumbing
to jihva vega. Now, it is not that we have to deliberately take food that is
tasteless to counter jihva vega. That is not our process. The, with.. Our
process is that whatever Krishna offers, we accept it. So if on some days,
wonderful prasadam is there, we will take it, on some other days, simple
prasadam is there, we will accept that also. So whenever there are feasts,
having opulent prasadam, it is fine. But we cannot have feast every day, or we
cannot, we cannot be looing look for feast every day.

Now, then second point is with respect to controlling jihva vega is, so one is
the regulation of the quantity and the variety, and then the other is the
regulation of the frequency. So jihva vega is, has three controls. Variety of
food that we take, should not be too opulent. Quantity should be regulated
depending on how much is suited for our body.

Generally speaking, there is hunger and there is pseudo hunger. So, hunger means
that the stomach is empty, and the stomach needs food to continue its
metabolical functions of the body. But pseudo hunger is if somebody says I am
hungry for gulab jamun. Hunger, real genuine hunger, is never specific. It is
generic. Specific hunger is always pseudo hunger. So, generic hunger means, when
the body needs things for its metabolism, then that means it needs some input by
which its functioning will go on. So, what the input it is, is not particularly
important from the body's metabolical point of view. It just needs fuel for
running on. And, of course, it has to, the, what is put in has to be nourishing,
but the point is that it is generic. You know, whether it is chapatis, or
whether it is bahakris, or whether it is paratas, or whether it is bread, cooked
by devotees, that does not matter so much. What matters is that, it should be
nourishing enough for the body.

But when there is pseudo hunger, that means there is I want this particular item
itself. Now, it is not wrong to want a particular item, if it is, can be offered
to Krishna and they can, that is fine. But we have to know what is the body's
actual need, and what is the mind's need. It is not that we have to reject all
the mind's needs, but at least we should know. Ok, this is the mind's needs, and
then I can decide whether I am going to fulfill the mind's needs or not. The
body's needs have to be fulfilled.

So, whenever the hunger becomes specific, not generic, that is a safe way to
understand that is not hunger, that is pseudo hunger. So pseudo hunger is what
causes fat. Genuine hunger does not cause fat. Genuine hunger does not even
actually bring our consciousness down to tama or rajaguna. When we overeat, then
we want to oversleep. Either we want to oversleep or because of overeating, then
people want to, people get into passion, and they want to enjoy. So, it,
generally, when we eat too much variety, too much quantity, then that sort of
eating can drag our consciousness down to passion or ignorance.

So, satisfying hunger does not lead to any such problems. It is only pseudo
hunger that causes these problems. So with respect to, after considering
controlling the quantity, the variety, then let us look at the frequency.
Now, frequency means that how often we should take prasad. There is the pastime
of Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya and Caitanya Mahaprabhu in the Caitanya Caritamrta
that after Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya had this momentous
conversation in the temple of Jaganath Puri, temple of Jaganath, and then
Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya was converted. The next morning Caitanya Mahaprabhu
came to meet Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya and gave him prasad, to, brought some
prasad for him. So, Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya has woken up late and he just came
out and saw Caitanya Mahaprabhu, offered obeisances. And then he got up. He said
I am so fortunate that I am able to see you. And then Caitanya Mahaprabhu gave
him prasadam, and he immediately took the prasadam on and ate. So then, he said.
What is this Sarvabhauma? He says you are a brahmana. You have not taken bath.
You have not done your sandhyavandana. How can you eat food like this?

And then, Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya said, he quoted a verse from the Purana
saying that "prapti-matrena bhoktavyam", he says that as soon as prasad is
obtained, immediately we should eat it. "prapti-matrena bhoktavyam". And
Caitanya Mahaprabhu has become so happy. It is said in Caitanya Caritamrta,
Caitanya Mahaprabhu felt as if the purpose of His descend from the spiritual
world had been fulfilled, that as if he had conquered the whole universe.

Now, what was Caitanya Mahaprabhu so ecstatic about? Now that eat prasad as soon
as you get it, that is not the the main lesson of this pastime. The main lesson
of this pastime is the transformation of the heart of Caitanya Ma... of
Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya and his development of faith in the principle of mercy.
He was earlier a dry logician. He was an impersonalist. And his fo..., he was
not focused so much on bhakti, although he was worshipping Jaganath. The idea
was that ultimately one has to use jnana, and those who are of this category,
they think that what brings advancement is the rigid adherence to the rules, not
so much the principle of mercy.

So, what Caitanya Mahaprabhu saw in this pastime is by that, Sarvabhauma
Bhattacharya's faith in the principle of mercy has become far greater than in
his, his faith in the rigid adherence of rules. So it was that which made
Caitanya Mahaprabhu elated.

So, when there are deity prasadam comes, and when one sees the prasadam as
mercy, and then one does not bother about one's rules, and takes the deity
prasadam. So that is, what is, it is the increased faith in the principle of
mercy as compared to the principle of rigid adherence of rules. That is what
Caitanya Mahaprabhu appreciated.

Now, in our case, what happens is, we are really not thinking of prasadam as mercy.
We think of prasadam as opportunity to enjoy. 30:26
