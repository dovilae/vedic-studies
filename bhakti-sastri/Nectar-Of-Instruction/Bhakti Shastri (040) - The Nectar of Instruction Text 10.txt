Hare Krishna.

Welcome back to Bhakti Sastri, Nectar of Instruction.

Today, we will be discussing the tenth verse. So, this verse talks about the
hierarchy of various levels of people. Previous verse was about various levels
of places. Now, among the various levels of people, we will start right from the
sinful materialist to the topmost of all devotees, Radharani. So, the scope of
this verse is breathtaking. Let us look at the verse:

        karmibhyaḥ parito hareḥ priyatayā vyaktiṁ yayur jñāninas
        tebhyo jñāna-vimukta-bhakti-paramāḥ premaika-niṣṭhās tataḥ
        tebhyas tāḥ paśu-pāla-paṅkaja-dṛśas tābhyo ’pi sā rādhikā
        preṣṭhā tadvad iyaṁ tadīya-sarasī tāṁ nāśrayet kaḥ kṛtī

So, "karmibhyaḥ", better than "karmibhyaḥ parito", than the karpi, karmis then
in all respects. "hareḥ priyatayā", they have been pur..., favored by Lord Hari.
Who are those people, "vyaktiṁ", those people, "yayur", "vyaktiṁ yayur" as it is
mentioned in the sastras. "vyaktiṁ yayur jñāninas", the jnani people, so better
than the karmis are the jnanis.

"tebhyo jñāna-vimukta-bhakti-paramāḥ", now, beyond that, greater than that are
those who are v..., liberated by knowledge, "jñāna-vimukta-bhakti-paramāḥ", and
they have become engaged in devotional service. So better jnanis are devotees.
Then, "premaika-niṣṭhās tataḥ", and among the devotees, those who have actually
developed the love for Krishna, "prema", they are better.

"tebhyas tāḥ paśu-pāla-paṅkaja-dṛśas", so "paśu-pāla", Krishna is called as
gopal, similarly "paśu-pāla", he was taking care of the animals.
"paṅkaja-dṛśas", so the Lord who is the protector of the, you know, cows. So the
gopis, they are lotus eeyes, and they are the beloved of that "paśu-pāla".
"tābhyo ’pi sā rādhikā", so that means about the devotees who have attained love
of God, are the gopis. And among them, about them, the highest is Radhika.

"preṣṭhā tadvad iyaṁ tadīya", and very dear to her, "tadīya-sarasī", her lake.
"tāṁ nāśrayet kaḥ kṛtī", who is there, who will not take shelter of that lake of
Radhakund. Who is that person? "kaḥ kṛtī", that fortunate person. "su-kṛtī",
"kṛtī" means one who has done good work, one who is fortunate.

Let us look at the translation:

"In the sastra it is said of all types of fruitive workers, he who is advanced
in knowledge of the higher values of life is favored by the Supreme Lord Hari.
Our of many such people who are advanced in knowledge [jnanis], one who is
practically liberated by virtue of his knowledge may take to devotional service.
He is superior to the others. However, one who has actually attained prema, pure
love of Krishna, is superior to him. The gopis are exalted above all devotees
because they are always totally dependent upon Sri Krsna, the transcendental
cowherd boy. Among the gopis, Srimati Radharani is the most dear to Krsna. Her
kunda [lake] is as profoundly dear to Lord Krsna as this most beloved of the
gopis. Who, then, will not reside at Radha-kunda and, in a spiritual body
surcharged with ecstatic devotional feelings [aprakrtabhava], render loving
service to the divine couple Sri Sri Radha-Govinda, who perform Their
astakaliya-lila, Their eternal eightfold daily pastimes. Indeed those who
execute devotional service on the banks of Radha-kunda are the most fortunate
people in the universe."

So, here, we see the hierarchy being described in the verse. Let us look at it
in the powerpoint. So, here we see that, there are six levels talked about. We
start from vi-karmis, at one end, and then from there we come to karmis, jnanis,
bhaktas, and among the bhaktas, the gopis and among them, the highest is
Shrimati Radharani. So, let us look at each one of them. Now, vi-karmis. What
are their characteristics? They act without Vedic knowledge. And this side of
actions are not appreciated by saintly persons. And they take birth as animals,
trees, and plants, is what Srila Prabhupada says in the purport.

So, here, actually, Srila Prabhupada includes this level which is not talked
about in the translation. The translation is talking of the karmis. But
Prabhupada s..., extends the scope to include all, all people in Kali Yuga also,
especially in our modern times. So, here, we have vi-karmis. So, Rupa Goswami
starts hierarchy from the karmis, because, you know he is talking about devotion
and he wants to talk about the rarity of devotion. So, he is talking about
people who are within the dharmic fold. But most people Ka..., Kali Yuga, in the
modern times especially, are not in the dharmic fold, which is unfortunate. But,
so most people are vi-karmis. Today, most people do not be..., follow sastra. And
they live lives which are quite unfortunate. Not just from a spiritual
perspective, but even from a material perspective. The scriptures, they act like
a mother. Now, whe..., when the mother embraces a child, you know, the child may
see the embrace of the mother as a restriction, but the intention of the mother
is not restriction. It is protection. So, what the Vedic scriptures offer us is
restrict..., not restriction, it is, if there may be some form of restriction,
which we may feel, but actually, the intention is not restriction. The intention
is protection. So, only when the child does not understand the intention of the
mother. Then, the child mistakes that restrict..., that protection to be
restriction.

So, similarly, the scriptures offer us some guidelines of how we should act, and
how we should not act. You know, these are not meant for restriction. They are
meant for protection. When we go out of those bounds, then we create suffering
for ourselves. Just as when some..., when a person tells the child, you know,
do not, there is a ten-storey building, there is a terrace, do not lean too much
off the terrace. Hence the child leans too much off the terrace and slips, and
falls. Then, you know, we cannot break the law of gravity. We will only break
ourselves against the law of gravity. Similarly, there are God's laws. And we
cannot break the laws of God. When we break those laws, we end up breaking
ourselves. So, that is the misfortune of people today. That, in one sense, it is
very strange though way people reason. You know, we gove..., we kn..., we have
recognised more and more through science that nature is governed by laws. And
right from the microscopic to the macroscopic level, we find that nature is
governed by laws. And of course, there are some areas where, they say, there are,
there seems to be chaos, but even that chaos follows certain patterns. And many
scientists intrinsically feel that even when we are by our certain behavior
seem to be chaotic, there must be certain laws which we are not able to figure
out. So, the laws may be of extremely high levels of complexity.

So, certain laws, which are simple, of course, even our psychology and m*M/r2
are not very simple law. But it is relatively simple. It describes the force
with which two objects, two parcticles of matter, two objects attach each other
through as gravity. It is simple. Now, if you go, if you go deeper, then there
are much more complex laws. So, Schrodinger equation, say, describes how, the,
in quantum physics the way function collapses. Now, it is complex equation.
But the point is that science as it is researching more and more, it is
discovering that matter of all those laws at every level. So, rather, it is
peculiar that we see that matter follows laws everywhere and wherever we do not
see the laws, we, even scientifically when people believe that there are laws.
And scientists are researching to find out what are the laws that we have not
yet figured out.

But yet, well, we exhibit matter follows us, we assume that , consciousness,
there are no laws governing consciousness. How, a..., what we think about, how
we let our thoughts grow into actions, what actions we choose to do, what
actions we does not choose to do. How can we say that there are no laws
governing this? So, it is not reasonable to say that. And that is why the real
challenge that comes up is that we have moral relativism today. Moral relativism
means, people say morality is relative. You think that is right. So, it is right
for you. If you think that is wrong, then that is wrong for you. But do not
impose it on me. And, now, there is no relativity with respect to gravity. If
somebody jumps out from a ten-storey, moves from a ten-storey building off the
terrace. Now, it does not matter that if the person is a theist or an atheist,
whether the person is a scientist or a non-scientist, Gravity is going to act.
Similarly, there is a laws of God, which will act. The only thing is that, the
difference is that in the case of gravity, we see the action immediately. The
person just falls and breaks the limbs. In the case of law of karma, and other
laws of nature. And the actions will lead to consequences. And the consequences
will not be immediately visible to us. And how precisely the actions lead to
consequences, that is something which we may not be able to figure out with our
finite brains.

Essentially, it took us centuries and centuries of study to understand some of
the complex laws of matter, laws governing matter, so what to speak of laws
governing consciousness. That will be much more complex. Consciousness is far
more subtle than matter. And consciousness itself has not yet been understood by
science. And what to speak of laws governing consciousness? But the point is
that wherever we see in science, we say, assume that there are laws and we try
to discover the laws. And even chaotic phenomena also, we try to u..., find out
some pattern underlying them, which we say are like laws. So, the question comes
up where, where can we know about the laws governing consciousness? That is
where the scriptures are there. The scriptures tell us ways in which we can,
should act. If we act in contrary ways, that will lead to harm. And if we act in
favorable harmonious ways, that will lead to good for us. That is our choice how
we should act. Now, when we talk about scriptures. Scriptures are not a way of
frozen text. Scriptures are a living text. Living text means, they live in the
hearts of those who have imbibed that principles. And in one sense, if we see,
the Vedic scriptures, they are omniform. Omniform means that there are many many
rules given in those scriptures. And the acharyas understand which rules to
apply in our current context. And when we apply those rules, then we move
forward and by that we understand that, we are actually gaining deeper
understanding of the universe and are not able to harmonise with the universe.

So, just as those who do not follow the law of gravity will have to bear the
consequences. Similarly, when we defy the laws of nature, then we will have to
bear the consequences. Now, how exactly to harmonise with the laws of nature?
That is given in principle in the scriptures and in practice, that will be
according to time, places, circumstance, explained by the acharyas. So, that is
why we need acharyas. And if, acharyas, like Srila Prabhupada, are explaining to
us how we should act in our lives. So, those who reject this, they are called as
vi-karmis. So, karma means activity. "vi-karma", means "vi" is "vru daru", you
know, opposite. So, those who act opposite to their own good interests. That
should, their interests are given in the scriptures. And Krishna describes this
kind of people in the 16th chapter. He describes, "The Divine And Demoniac
Natures" is the name of the chapter. And practically, the whole chapter, after
the first three verses, is about the demoniac nature. And in 16.23, Krishna says
that those who reject sastra, what is the result for them?

        yah sastra-vidhim utsrjya
        vartate kama-karatah
        na sa siddhim avapnoti
        na sukham na param gatim

So, Krishna says that "yah sastra-vidhim utsrjya", those who give away
scripture, those who turn away from scripture, those who reject scripture. And
then how do they act? Naturally, they will act based on their own selfish
desires. "vartate kama-karatah", so there is nothing to regulate their desires.
They act according to their own desires. So, what happens to them? "na sa
siddhim avapnoti". They do not attain "siddhim", they do not attain any
perfection.  "na sukham na param gatim", they do not attain any happiness. Nor
do they attain the supreme destination of life. So, now, Krishna is talking
about "sukham" in this life. But actually, they do not get happiness in this
life, what to speak of next? So, why not happiness in this life? Because, you
know, when desires become unregulated, then people suffer even in this life. We,
at the extreme level, we see this in addictions where people think that I will
drink to enjoy, or I will smoke to enjoy. But then, you know, they f..., they
take drink first and then they become drunk. And first, they cash the drink and
then the drink catches them. And the drink catches them, you know, vicious grip,
that finally chokes off their life so many times.

So, that is extreme example. But even in general, when desires go out of
control, then people suffer terribly. And today, we see so many psychological
problems people are suffering from. Actually, the mental problems society is
suffering from today are far more than ever before in human history. And the
reason for this primarily is that people are having so many wild desires. And
the desires are like the fuel for the mind. And the more the desires, the
greater will be the fuel for the mind, and of course, if the desires are
spiritual, then the mind goes in Krishna, in direction of Krishna. But if the
desires are material, then the mind goes in the direction of so many material
objects. A..., and the mind is hyper energised. And our body's capacity to
enjoy are limited. Our resources are limited. We have some notation because of
our social culture. And because of all this, our, the mind's fantasies are
frustrated. So, then, the mind goes wild, when it says, as I am not fulfilled.

So, the vi-karmis suffer even in this life. They suffer because of I am
controlled mind. Then, that is why the scriptures say that we should, you know,
at least become karmis. We discussed earlier how in today's parlance, often
ISKCON uses the kar..., word karmis to refer to materialists. But in the Vedic
context and even here "karmibhyaḥ parito hareḥ", there the word karmi refers,
not to vi-karmis, it refers to karmi kandis. Karma-kandis are religious
materialists. So, let us look at these religious materialists.

So, karmis act according to Vedic knowledge. They are superior to vi-karmis.
They are elevated to higher planets like the Moon. And they return to
martya-loka. So, the karmis, what do they do? They primarily focus on material
enjoyment only. So, vi-karmis and karmis, both are interested in material
enjoyment. The difference is that karmis are focusing on getting material
enjoyment within the precincts of dharma. They follow scripture to get material
enjoyment. So, this is definitely better. Because they are not going into sin.
And by this, they will, this path of gradual elevation. So, the Vedic program is
that, it will provide for both our spiritual and material needs. It is not that
the Vedic scriptures tell us that because you have to practi..., have to go back
to Godhead, so just forget your body, starve. No. They provide us not just a
philosophical understanding of how, what all sadhanas we should do to go back to
Godhead. But they also give a program how to live in this world. In fact,
varnashram is a systematic social arrangement to facilitate people to live
spiritually. And actually, you know, the Vedic culture is, as far as history
goes, even, you know, even from the modern historical perspective, the only
example where a ho..., co..., comprehensive social model has been estab...,
recommended and established for the sake of facilitating a spiritual journey.

This is something which has not been there in other religions. You know, for
example, in there, there are, the male, mother, other major religions of the world,
Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism. Buddhism of course was offshot from Hinduism
only. So, many of the social models of Hinduism are still there. It is an offshot
of Vedic culture basically. The name Hinduism was not there at that time. But,
as per historical nomenclature, but if you see, in Islam, they have, after the
prophet came, and then, based on his teachings, they have made the Sharia. And
they have certain laws. Every religion has certain laws for how it should
conduct its people. But organising the whole society according to an arrangement
that will facilitate spiritual advancement. That is a massive, massive endeavor.
And practically, nobody has been able to do that. So varnashram was that model.
And it was implemented in Vedic culture.

So, it is understand that, you know, that people will take time to make
spiritual advancement. At the same time, everybody should be kept on a
progressive spiritual path. So these two, at least two factors, that give people
time, at the same time making sure they are staying on the right track, that is
arranged through varnashram. Those who want to make rapid advancement. Those who
want to devote themselves to Krishna, they can just devote themselves. And
Krishna says that:

        sarva-dharman parityajya
        mam ekam saranam vraja

Just surrender unto me. That is the highest as far as the Bhagavad Gita is
concerned. But the varnashram helps people when they are not on "sarva-dharman
parityajya" platform, then they can practice varnashram by that, they can make
spiritual advancement by that also. So, this whole karma-kanda system is, we
sometimes dismiss it, karma kanda, we should give it up. Sometimes, we will
quote Narottama Das Thakur saying "jnana-kanda, kar...", "karma-kanda,
jnana-kanda, kevala visera bhanda". So, that karma-kanda and jnana-kanda, they
are simply poison. Now, actually, this is from a pure devotional perspective.
That a pure devotee feels that, apart from devotional service, everything is
undesirable. Because pure devotional service alone will sat..., alone will
satisfy the heart. Nothing else will else satisfy. Now, that is definitely true.
At the same time, you know, not everybody is capable of aspiring for pure
devotional service. So, the Vedic scriptures, the way broad Vedic scriptures do
not say that if you cannot surrender to God, then you have to go to hell. Say,
no, if you cannot surrender to God, there are other levels that, which you can
practice spiritual life also. 

So, karma-kanda is one of those, intermediate arrangements. So, the Bha..., from
the Bhagavatam perspective, from the pure devotional perspective, Bhagavatam
calls even karma-kanda as "kaithava-dharma", that, and it says, this, this sort
of kaithava-dharma is kicked out of the Bhagavatam. So, "dharmaḥ
projjhita-kaitavo ’tra", so in the Bhagavatam's point of view, this "projjhita",
it has to be given up. This is focused on pure devotional service. But from the
point of view of people in general, who are not at the level of practicing
Bhagavatam, then for them, the karma-kanda is important. It provides a social
arrangement by which they can progress materially and also progress spiritually.
So, what is this karma-kanda? We have discussed this in our Isopanishad classes.
There is dharma, artha, kama and moksha. So, actually, when we start seeking
moksha, one goes to the level of jnani. Dharma, artha, kama is what a person
seeks for when a person is a karmi. So, they follow Vedic regulations. And their
idea is that they understand that their karma happens automatically. There is God
in control. And God acts through His various agents. So, when they want grains.
They understand that we human beings have to work for it. But along with that,
higher sanction is also required. So, they will go and plough their fields, they
will sow their grains. And they will take care of the farm. But along with that,
they understand that r..., rains, fertility of the soil, multiple other factors,
absence of pests, the proper presence of veins and everything, so many other
factors are there, which are required for the proper harvest, that are not in
our hands. And they do not think that simplistic lives are all happening by key,
by chance. Sometimes, there is a good harvest because the weather was good.
Sometimes, there is a bad harvest because the weather was bad. They do not see,
whe..., they do not see things like that. They are much more informed.

Where the modern eyes see simply dead matter moving according to impersonal laws
and mechanical forces with the cloud of the dead matter, and they are moving
according to impersonal laws and mechanical forces. Wind is making it blow. And
sometimes preacher sees and rains fall. So, where matter, where the material eye
sees only matter moving according to impersonal forces and mechanical laws,
there the spirit..., there itself, the spiritual eye sees the Supreme Lord
acting in association with His agents, a..., coordinating the movings of the
material nature. So, yes, this is a material phenomena that when clouds come in
a particular area that in pictures change, and then rain happens. But how does
all this happen? This happens under the supervision of the Supreme Lord. And if
that supervision, Supreme Lord, that is being referred to by the karmis. So, the
karmis understand that if we want something in life, we have to satisfy the
Supreme Lord and through Him satisfying His agents. So, for that, the karmis do
karma kanda, and by that they make gradual advancement. Slowly, slowly, slowly,
they move forward in the spiritual life. So, the whole verse describes that,
those who do like this, they are also serving Krishna. And they are doing it
indirectly.

        trai-vidya mam soma-pah puta-papa
        yajnair istva svar-gatim prarthayante
        te punyam asadya surendra-lokam
        asnanti divyan divi deva-bhogan

So, it is described that they perform yagnas, 24:37
