    prapanna parijataya
    totra vetraika panaye
    jnana mudraya krishnaya
    gitamrita duhe namah

Hare Krishna. Welcome to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are now in
the 17th Chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. You know. We are discussing about
"yajña-dāna-tapaḥ" in the three modes. So, we discussed about "yajña". You know.
You know. Now, as a part of, you know, "tapaḥ". We will be discussing about
austerity of body. Austerity of mind. And austerity of speech. So, let us start
that discussion now. You know. 17.14 in the Bhagavad Gita. We discussed the, you
know, 13th verse.

        deva-dvija-guru-prājña-
        pūjanaṁ śaucam ārjavam
        brahmacaryam ahiṁsā ca
        śārīraṁ tapa ucyate

So, "deva-dvija-guru-prājña-". So, the, here, it is describing that we should
respect "pūjanaṁ". "pūjanaṁ" means, it does not necessarily have to mean
"pū...", doing "pūja" literally. That can also be one aspect of it. You know.
You know. So, it is necessarily even doing worship. But it basically means
respecting. So, doing "pūja" is one way of expressing respect. So, who are all
the people to be respect? "deva". "deva" can refer to the Supreme Lord. "deva"
can refer to the devatas, also. So, Prabhupada explains that they wor...,
worship the Supreme Lord. Because ultimately, the Supreme Lord is the greatest
of all the devas. So, "deva", "deva". He is also referred to. You know. In, when
we want to contrast. And establish His supreme position. But "deva" is also a,
you know, one way to refer to the Supreme Lord. So, "deva-dvija-guru-prājña-".
"dvija". Other brahmanas. "guru" is, you know, all brahmanas in general are
spiritual teachers. But there is one particular brahmana who becomes our
specific spiritual master. "deva-dvija-guru-prājña-". And in general, anybody
who is advanced in knowledge. So, Chanakya Pandit says that, you know, you know,
you know, a, a powerful person may be respected in his own area. But a
knowledgeable person is able to un..., on, respect everywhere. Because of
the wisdom that that person has. So, "prājña". One who is wise is respected. So,
these are all people, we should respect.

        deva-dvija-guru-prājña-
        pūjanaṁ śaucam ārjavam

"śaucam". Cleanliness. Cleanliness means, well, per..., we have talked about
this repeatedly. Several times that has come in the Bhagavad Gita. Internal and
external cleanliness. "ārjavam". "ārjavam" is, as Prabhupada translates over
here, simplicity. Or straightforwardness. This is also quality been mentioned
earlier. You know. And:

        brahmacaryam ahiṁsā ca
        śārīraṁ tapa ucyate

So, all these are "śārīraṁ tapa". They are, the, austerities of the body.
"śā...", "ār...", What is it? So, "brahmacaryam ahiṁsā ca". So, "brahmacaryam"
and "ahiṁsā", it is interesting that Krishna has coupled them together over
here. Earlier, we have, saw how Krishna was coupling in "kāma" and "krodha"
together. So:

        kāma-krodha-vimuktānāṁ

You know. You know.

        kāma-krodhodbhavaṁ vegaṁ

So, He has been coupling "kāma" and "krodha" together several times in the
Bhagavad Gita. So, "kāma". The, the way to control "kāma" is to practice
"brahmacaryam". You know. The way to kept, you know, control, you know,
"krodha", is to practice "ahiṁsā". So:

        brahmacaryam ahiṁsā ca
        śārīraṁ tapa ucyate

"śārīraṁ tapa". These are austerities of the body. So, in general, all our
activities can be classified into these three categories. Those which are, with,
do the body. With the speech. And with the mind. So, you know, you know, we also
discov..., you know, discussed about, you know, these three, these different
"vegaṁ". Which Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura also classifies into bodily,
mental and verbal. So, the sannyasis also have the "ta...", three "daṇḍa". Which
also indicates that they will, which has three parts in it. And which indicates
thus, they will serve the Lord. With their body. With their mind. And with their
speech. You know. You know. So, "deva-dvija". So, what is Prabhupada telling
over here in this purport? Let us have a look briefly. You know. You know. You
know. You know. So, Prabhupada says:

"One should offer, or learn to offer,"

You know. And Prabhupada also includes the God. Or the demigods. That means
what? "offer, or learn to offer". That means austerity is also something which
we may not feel like doing. But we do it. Now, when the devotees asked Srila
Prabhu..., you know, you know, Prabhupada has told the etiquette of offering
obeisances to the spiritual master. And the devotees asked Prabhupada, we do not
feel like doing it. You know. You know. One devotee asked Srila
Prabhupada. So, Prabhupada, you know, I do not fee..., he was, devotees were
not offering obeisances. So, Prabhupada asked him, why are you not offering
obeisances? You know. Prabhupada had to educate devotees. He himself had to ask.
You know. So, at that time, the devotees said that Prabhupada, I did not, you
know, you know, I did not feel like offering obeisances. So, Prabhupada said
you do offer obeisances. Then, gradually, the feeling will come. You know. So,
it is said that when the deities come in front of us. When the darshan opens.
You know. That once devotees, you know, they feel so ecstatic. They feel so
overwhelmed with joy. That often they feel it in ecstasy. This is, "Chaitanya
Mahaprabhu", sometimes, when he would get darshan of Krishna, you know, just run
in that direction. And then, suddenly, faint completely. So, that is, you know,
the idea that, you know, when a pure devotee is, an exal..., advanced devotee,
they get darshan of Krishna, they faint. And if he cannot faint, then at least,
we fall down. So, when there is pure love, there will be ecstatic fainting. But
at least, if not, then there is falling. You know. Falling in obeisances. This
is austerity. Even we do not feel like doing, do it. What will happen? By this,
itself a proper set of culture, you know, cultural impressions are created
within our minds. So, we learn to offer respect. You know. You know. So, the,
all these are bodily austerities. So, "ahiṁsā" means, somebody gets, you know,
somebody provokes us, at that time, it is, you know, it is, you know, it
requires willpower. And discipline. You know. You know. To, you know, you know,
not lash out. And hit out at somebody, who has provoked us. You know. You know.
So, how do we avoid that provocation? That is an austerity. You know. How, how
do we avoid getting provoked when somebody, means when the provocation comes.
That is an austerity. Now, you know, in general, you know, you know, in material
life, people messages that count until ten. So that you do not ae..., come to
anger. That may help. A devotee may count Hare, chant Hare Krishna maha mantra
ten times. A devotee may remember some verses. You know. Which con..., you know,
talk about the danger of anger, you know, danger of anger. But in general, you
know, all, every devotee has to develop one's own pause button. You know. You
know. Pause button means, just like when a, you know, movie is playing. And
then, you know, we do not want it to move onwards. So, pause. So, like that,
when we are moving forward, at that time, we realise that, oh, I am not going in
the right dire..., I am going in the wrong direction. I am doing something
which, you know, if I move in this direction. I will end up doing something
dangerous. So, then, tuck. We have to have our own pause button. Which checks
us. So, what does the pause button mean? Pause button does not necessarily mean
that we have to become motionless completely. Pause button means we have to stop
our mind from following its default tra..., trajectory towards, you know,
temptation. And then fall, fall down. You know. So, the, that pause button may
be for some devotees by chanting. For some devotees, by hearing kirtans. By
s..., by, by maybe reading one's own, some inspirational passages which we have
taken from scripture. You know. Which we have, some, you know, some mo...,
motivational points we have heard in classes. All of us have to, you know, this
is where the individual aspect of Krishna Consciousness comes up. You know. I
have my mind. You have your mind. And the way you will fight with your mind will
be different from the way I will fight with my mind. So, we all have to find out
our ways. And fight according to our ways. Whatever those ways may be. You know.
You know. So, it is how we fight against the mind. And we make spiritual
advancement.
 
So, we will have to individualise. Although the principles are universal. But
the specific ways in which we apply them may be, you know, spe..., may be
different for different individuals. But this is the austerity of the body. You
know. You know. You know. So, it is interesting now that what is put it
simplicity. Now, "ārjavam" can be con..., translated as straightforwardness.
Which will be more an inner attribute. "ārjavam" can be translated as
simplicity, also. So, now, ar..., you know, the word "Arjuna" is related with
the word "ārjavam". "ārjavam". Arjuna. So, they have a similar, you know, and
cognate sense. The idea is that, you know, "ārjavam" means simplicity. So, you
know, the more simpler we live, the more we have time for, you know, higher
thought. You know. Simple living. And higher thinking. Simple living and high
thinking. Why is it mentioned? You know. Prabhupada also talks about the plain
living. And high thinking. Why? Because the simpler our living, the more we have
time for high thinking. The more complex our living, then the more, our, you
know, co..., thoughts get caught up in the living, only. So, this does not mean
that a devotee cannot use technology. A devotee cannot have opulence. No. What
is required. What is required. Now, the media pressure, the cultural pressure is
such that today that people acquire gadgets. And conveniences. And trinkets.
Just for the sake of glamor. Just for the sake of prestige. You know. We have
discussed earlier about shopaholism. So, for a devotee, what will simplicity be?
That will vary according to time, place, circumstance. You know. Every devotee
has to decide. You know. What level of engagement with material things is
necessary for my, my service? My social position? You know. And what necessary
level of engagement is sucking me in? So, that is something which every devotee
has to decide. And accordingly, live. We may not be able to disconnect ourselves
entirely from material, ma..., from technology and such things. But that does
not necessarily mean that we have to entangle ourselve..., let ourselves
completely entangled in them. So, instead of simple living and high thinking,
many people end up simply living and hardly thinking. Simply living. Hardly
thinking. What does that mean? That mean..., now, so, sure, it is not that
people are hardly thinking. So, then, they are not thinking. See, everybody
thinks. You know. We are all the time thinking. Even when a, you know, you know,
he-dog is attracted to a she-dog. You know. The he-dog is thinking. So, when
male is attracted to female. Or a female is attracted to male. They are
thinking. But that thinking is not really considered thinking. Because it is
simply at the bodily level. It is at the animal level. And there is nothing, you
know, very exalted about that. So, therefore, real thinking is thinking at the
spiritual level. And simple living facilitates high thinking. You know. You
know. And the living is complex, then, oh, I have to do this, also. I have to
manage that, also. I have to take care of this, also. I have to take, so, you
know, todos at the material level itself become so many. And so complex. That
they suck our mental energy. So, Prabhupada is talking here about "ārjavam" as
simplicity. You know. You know. You know. Generally, the more wealth we earn,
the more we rise in social status. But then, the more we have to struggle to
maintain that social status, also. And that also brings its own entanglements.
That also brings its own irritations. That also brings its own, you know,
complications. And agitations. That is why a devotee tries to live as simply as
is possible. The, given the, you know, you know, given the limitations of time,
place, and circumstance. You know. You know. Now, after describing this, now, of
course, we will not go too much into "brahmacaryam". Because that has been topic
which we have discussed repeatedly over here.

        brahma carati iti brahmacarya

One who li..., tries to live on the spiritual platform. That is a brahmacarya.
Then:

        anudvega-karaṁ vākyaṁ
        satyaṁ priya-hitaṁ ca yat
        svādhyāyābhyasanaṁ caiva
        vāṅ-mayaṁ tapa ucyate

You know. You know. "anudvega-karaṁ vākyaṁ". You know. You know. You know. You
know. "anudvega-karaṁ vākyaṁ". You know. You know. You know. "anudvega" means to
decrease the agitation. "anudvega-karaṁ vākyaṁ". That which does not cause
agitation. "vāky...". The words which do not agitate others. Then, "satyaṁ
priya-hitaṁ ca yat". "satyaṁ". Those which are truthful. You know. "priya".
Those which are pleasing. You know. And then, those which are beneficial.
"svādhyāyābhyasanaṁ caiva". That means words which involve, "svādhy...", you
know, "svādhyāya". Study. And then, "abhyasanam". Practice. So, Prabhupada
translate this as recitation of scripture. Regularly recitation scripture.
"svādhyāyābhyasanaṁ caiva". We study. And then, we recite scripture. All this is
"vāṅ-mayaṁ tapa ucyate". You know. "vāṅ-mayaṁ tapa". Austerity of the speech.
So, Prabhu..., we have discussed earlier in "vāco vegaṁ" how, you know, the
materialistic tendency is to talk about hundreds and hund..., millions of
things. And the spiritual tendency is to, and the spiritual inclination is to
fu..., keep the speech chased and focused on Krishna. And things related with
Krishna. So, here, Krishna is not necessarily talking about bhakta. He is
talking in general about austerity. And He is talking about how even from a
material point of view, one should be able to discipline and regulate oneself.
So, "anudvega-karaṁ vākyaṁ". How should one speak? Generally speaking, you know,
sarcasm, and, you know, you know, you know, sarcasm is often considered to be a
sign of intelligence. Where people want to hur..., hurt others. And they speak
in such a way that the more they can hurt others, the thing, more that they are
thinking that they are clever. But actually, you know, you know, to be sarcastic
may require cleverness. But that is not the, that is not really the desirable
use of cleverness. The desirable use of cleverness is to bring others closer to
us. And closer to, you know, Krishna through us. Or even closer to the right
track in general. Even at the material level. So, by agitating people, whether
that is going to happen, you know, it is unlikely. You know. Very often, you
know, you know, we may end up not, not educating, but alienating people. If we
speak strongly. Sometimes, we talk about how the spiritual master or the sadhu
cuts. So, the sadhu cuts. And what does the sadhu cut? The material attachments
of the conditioned souls. And the sadhu cuts the material attachments of the
conditioned souls. And helps them to come to, closer to Krishna. So, that is
used, you know, that example of that, in the First Canto of "Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam".
When Vidura speaks strongly to "Dhṛtarāṣṭra". And gets him out of, you know, his
attachments. So, you know, that is good. You know. To get somebody out of
material entanglement. But, you know, we see that Vidura, before that, had a
long history of a very deep and intimate relationship, you know, with, you know,
"Dhṛtarāṣṭra". And when he spoke those words, those words penetrated. Otherwise,
the words do not penetrate. We may end up, you know, sometimes, when we chastise
people, instead of cutting their anarthas, the "bīja" of their anarthas, we may
end up cutting their "bhakti-latā-bīja", only. That mean..., the
"bhakti-latā-bīja" is that which is to be nourished. You know. And that which
should grow. Grow. Grow. But when people are corr..., reckless. Then, you know,
while cutting, our intention may be to cut the anarthas. But our speech may
discourage people so much in the same of chastising. And disciplining. And
correcting. That we end up cutting the "bhakti-latā-bīja", only. And we cut the
"bhakti-latā-bīja". And then, most people can get lost. We may think that I have
spoken Krishna's message for that other person's good. But good intentions are
not good enough. You know. You know. People should feel, you know, people should
feel the trust in us. People should feel that we are their well-wishers. Then,
they will be able to see our good intention. Otherwise, they will see us
suspicious, through their, you know, default, you know, filters of suspicion. And
scepticism. And then, when we speak strongly. And, you know, or we, we speak
har..., what they feel as harshly. Insensitively. You know. Then, they may just
close down. And then, they will go away from Krishna by that. So, and this is
not just with respect to Krishna Consciousness. Even in normal human
relationships. You know, There are, most of the relationship conflicts within a
family, within a, you know, within any social circle, most of the relationship
conflicts come up because of carelessness, you know, in, you know, speech.
Because of insensitivity in dealing with people. You know. So, "anudvega-karaṁ
vākyaṁ". Whenever we have to speak. You know. It is, "viśva...", it is not that
we have to speak, you know, false just to make sure that people's mind do not
get agitated. But Krishna is putting "satyaṁ" as second. The first, He is
putting as "anudvega-karaṁ". Speak in a non-agitating way. That does not mean
speak false. Speak the truth. As is the Subhashita. It says:

        satyaṃ brūyāt priyaṃ brūyānna brūyāt

Now, "brūyāt". "satyaṃ, you know, "satyamapriyam". "nāditaṃ...", "satyaṃ".

        nānṛtaṃ brūyādeṣa dharmaḥ sanātanaḥ

What is this? "satyaṃ brūyāt priyaṃ brūyānna brūyāt". You know. Speak the truth.
But speak it palatably. Speak palatable truth. "na brūyāt satyamapriyam". If
some truth is unpalatable, then better not speak it. "nānṛtaṃ", "priyaṃ
brūyānna". That do not speak false just because there is falsehood. Just because
it is palatable. "eṣa dharmaḥ sanātanaḥ". This is an eternal principle. As
"Chanakya Pandit" says that, you know, the most important tr..., if somebody
wants to rule the whole world, the most important power for that person is the
power of proper speech. 18:26
