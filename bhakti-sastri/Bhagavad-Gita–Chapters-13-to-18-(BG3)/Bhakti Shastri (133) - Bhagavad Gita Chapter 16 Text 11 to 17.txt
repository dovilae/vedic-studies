Hare Krishna. Welcome back to the Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are
now in the, you know, 16th Chapter. We discussed, you know, the errors. And the
disasters of, you know, of the demoniac world view. And like, living. Now, we
will continue that. And the demons are motivated by lust. And by greed. They
want to enjoy sense gratification. For that, they want money. So, dharma. Arta.
Kama. Moksha. These four are the, you know, you know, they form a balanced world
view. But the demons want to remove dharma out. And they want to cut off moksha,
also. So, artha and kama is also, all are, is all that they want. And Krishna
talks about the, how:

        bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁ
        tayāpahṛta-cetasām

So, "bhoga" is kama. And "aiśvarya" is artha. And both of these abduct the soul
away. So, let us look at the verses. So, now, right now, in the overview part if
we see, you know, you know, what we are looking at is the activities of the
demoniac. So, how do they act? We will look at this.

        cintām aparimeyāṁ ca
        pralayāntām upāśritāḥ
        kāmopabhoga-paramā
        etāvad iti niścitāḥ

        āśā-pāśa-śatair baddhāḥ
        kāma-krodha-parāyaṇāḥ
        īhante kāma-bhogārtham
        anyāyenārtha-sañcayān

So, "cintām aparimeyāṁ ca". "cintām" is anxiety. "aparimeyāṁ ca". Unlimited
anxiety. Immeasurable anxiety. "pralayāntām upāśritāḥ". "pralayāntām". Until the
moment of "pralay". So, "pralay", as we have discussed earlier can refer to
cosmic destruction. Or it can be, re..., refer to the destruction at the time of
death of within a person. "pralayāntām upāśritāḥ". "upāśritāḥ". "upāśritāḥ". So,
until the moment of death, they are filled with anxiety. In fact, they have
taken shelter of those anxieties. Now, why would somebody take shelter of
anxieties? Actually, one does not take shelter of anxieties. But one takes
shelter of something that leads to anxieties. What is that? You know.
"kāmopabhoga-paramā". "kāma-upabhoga". The enjoyment of sense gratification. Of
lust. Of sensuality. "paramāḥ". "paramāḥ" is supreme. That Prabhupada translate
that that sense, they have ascertained it, sense gratification is the prime
necessity of life. "paramāḥ". Prabhupada in the word to word translation put it,
"the highest goal of life". They think that, yeah, you know, the, that,
everything in life is meant to give us "kāma-upabhoga". "etāvad iti niścitāḥ".
"etāvad". You know. This they have ascertained. This is certainty. "iti
niścitāḥ". "āśā-pāśa-śatair baddhāḥ". "āśā-pāśa". They are bound by desires. And
how many desires? "śatair baddhāḥ". Hundreds of desires.
"kāma-krodha-parāyaṇāḥ". "kāma-krodha". Lust and anger. They are, they have sold
themselves out to lust and anger. "īhante kāma-bhogārtham". And for the sake of
"kāma-bhogā", "īhante". For the sake of enjoying sense gratification.
"anyāyenārtha-sañcayān". So, "a-sañcayān" is to collect. So, "anyā" is
injustice. Immorality. Illegality. So, you know, you know, they immorally
collect wealth. How they collect wealth immorally will be discussed in the next
verse. So, let us look at this verse a little bit more. So, you know, you know,
this verse talks about, first and foremost, "cintām aparimeyāṁ ca". So, you
know, in life, we can either do "cintān". Or we do "cintā". "cintān" is
contemplation. Especially contemplation on the Supreme Lord. On the higher truth
of life. And the highest truth is Krishna. So, contemplation on Krishna is
"cintān". So, "cintām a...", if we do not do "cintān", if our mind does not have
a steady, satisfying, stabilising, you know, you know, object of thought, then
the mind naturally thinks about worldly things. And when we think about worldly
things, the result is, because none, no worldly thing i..., is ever-lasting. It
cannot offer us any shel..., you know, lasting shelter. So, therefore, the
result is "cintām". You know. If we think about sense objects, then there is
"cintām". Whether I will get it or not. If I get it, will it stay with me or
not? If it stays with me, how long will it stay with me? Will it go away when,
future? You know. "cintām aparimeyāṁ ca". And actually, these anxieties are
immeasurable. Immeasurable. Why? Because there are so many desires. And each of
the desires leads to anxieties. You know. So, and until when do the anxieties
last? "pralayāntām". You know. Even until the moment of death. We just stay on
in anxieties. On. And on. And on. And on. You know. Kali Yuga is so perverse
that, you know, all the troubles have become multiplied. Especially, in our, you
know, in the modern times where people have gone further and further away from
God. Why is that? Because the important point is to recognise that, you know,
when people do not have a stabilising shelter, then they are left at the mercy
of the mind's vagaries. And the mind takes them here. Buffets them. Here and
there. And wherever the mind goes, they, their thoughts go. And because the
mind is restless, they remain restless. So, you know, you know, you know, this
is a broad principle which acro..., cuts across, you know, religious boundaries.
And then, Saint Augustine said that, you know, You, oh, God, oh, Lord, you have
made us, you know, for seeking each, a rest on You. And without You, we find
nei..., we never find any rest. So, "cintām aparimeyāṁ ca". Immeasurable anxiety
remains. And, you know, you know, we see that one of the primary defining
characteristics of the modern civilisation is "cintām". That wherever modern
civilisation has gone, there, you know, the, you know, stress has come about.
So, there are, there is basic trouble in the material world. Vaikuntha. Kuntha
is, this world is kuntha. The, that means there is anxiety in this world. That
is true. But the modern anxiety is far, far, you know, far, far le..., you know,
levels more. Many levels more. That is because it is actually "cintām".
"cintām". It is crea..., there is so much pride, you know, so much pressure. So
many things to do. So many, so many uncertainties. And so many complications.
You know. So, because of "cintām aparimeyāṁ ca". So, you know, you know, you
know, you know, and stress itself is one problem. But stress according to
World Health Organisation, you know, stress and mental health problems are going
to be the biggest problems. You know. In the current century. Biggest health
problems. Biggest, you know, health challenge. So, AIDS. Cancer. Heart attack.
These are the major killers. But stress is also, you know, you know, the huge
threat. Which, you know, not only takes its own t..., all dir..., takes its all
directly. But also, contributes to a variety of mental problems. There are
anxiety disorders that peo...., people have. And there is, you know, there is,
actually, according to some health researchers, you know, in many western
societies. What is called as an anxiety epidemic. Anxiety epidemic means there
is so much anxiety among the people that, you know, there are people who have
a righteous of disorders. And, you know, mental, you know, and men..., mental
problems which all, you know, comprise the anxiety epidemic. So, you know, he
says, there is an eight epidemic. Or there are, there can be a, you know, you
know, epidemic of TB. Or, you know, different diseases. So, anxiety.

Now, we may say, anxiety, cool down, man. Do not worry. Do not worry. Now, do
not worry is a very simple statement to say. But for people who are afflicted by
anxiety, giving up anxiety is not easy. And especially, this anxiety becomes
manifold. When, you know, the, the, we may not think about why the anxiety is
there. And, you know, people do not even realise it. Anxiety comes because of
desires and attachments. So, the more our desires and attachments, the greater
is our anxiety. You know. You know. "kāmopabhoga-paramā". So,
"kāmopabhoga-paramā". So, when we have that desire to enjoy sense gratification,
You know. And we make that the supreme goal of life. Then, everything becomes
centered on that. So, if I try to enjoy the sense objects, will I be able to
enjoy?  No. Will I get that object? No. Will it stay with me? Or there are so
many complications come up because of, you know, you know, because of that
desire for sense gratification. So, "cintām aparimeyāṁ ca". You know. You know.
So, you know, the, both the "Avantī brāhmaṇa". And the "Avadhut brāhmaṇa". These
are the two, you know, re..., renunciates in the "Bhāgavatam" among the many
renunciates. Who speak out. And they give profound realisations. So, "paśyāmi
dhanināṁ kleśaṁ". So, the "Avantī brāhmaṇ...", the "Avadhut brāhmaṇa", in the
Seventh Canto says "paśyāmi". I am seeing what? "dhanināṁ kleśaṁ"'. "kleśaṁ".
People are simply in misery. You know. where thi..., "virtaya arte haya". And
the "Avantī brāhmaṇa" says, "virtaya arte haya". "virtaya". In futile, "arte
haya", person works extremely hard. Craves. And slaves for, you know, gaining
wealth. But ultimately, what one gets is anxiety. So, the more we are attached
to things, the more we suffer the anxieties. You know. Once, I wrote a poem
about this that, you know, you know, you know, people in the parties are, seen
to be cheers. And that is seen as a sign of celebration. But what is often the
reality, their hearts are filled with fears. Their minds are pierced by desires.
You know. These two things. You know. Fears. "cintām aparimeyāṁ ca". Minds are
pierced by desires. "āśā-pāśa-śatair baddhāḥ". So, "kāma-krodha-parāyaṇāḥ". So,
their hearts are filled with fears. Their minds are filled, pierced by desires.
You know. Every desire is like a st..., sharp stab. Pierces. Ok. I want this. I
want this. I want this. You know. And the minds are filled with, your know,
fea..., pierced by desires. They are on the verge of tears. So, because of fears
and desires, they are on the verge of tears. And they say cheers. So, they say
cheers. So, it is, it is a case of smiling faces. And crying hearts. People are
actually not happy. Although, they may put on a facade of happiness. So, you
know, "cintām aparimeyāṁ ca". Unlimited anxiety. And when people think that
there is no goal other than sense gratification. Or the sense gratification is
the highest goal of life, then, you know, the object which they are chasing is
not under control. And it may, and there i..., it may be, it may go off because
somebody else may, there are hundreds of other people wanting it. You know.
Sense obje..., sense gratification. There is so much competition for it. And
there is, ok, you know, there can be savagery in that competition, also. You
know. So, what happens is when people desire, make sense gratification their
goal, then the desires become their masters.

        āśā-pāśa-śatair baddhāḥ

And all the desires, they are invisible ropes. Noses. "pāśa" is nose. Which is,
which are pulling them. Pulling them. Dragging them. "āśā-pāśa-śatair baddhāḥ".
"śatair". Hundred of, you know, desires. "pāśa". They are all bound by that. And
then, "kāma-krodha-parāyaṇāḥ". So, they have become "kāma-krodha-parāyaṇāḥ".
Instead of becoming "nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇāḥ". You know. Instead of being devoted to
"Lord Nārāyaṇa", they have become devoted to "kāma-krodha". To lust. And anger.
And, you know, you know, "kāma". Why, why "kāma" and "krodha"? Because we have
desires. And we do not get desires. You know. I want to be the enjoyer. There is
the desire. And when at, and when I do not get enjoyment, then nobody should be
the enjoyer. Destroy everything. "krodha". So, that is why, you know, whenever
people, there, there are love affairs. And then, there is frustration. You know.
Often, you know, one, one de..., jilted partner wants to attack. And, you know,
you know, deface. Or even destroy the other partner. You know. "kāma", when
unsatisfied, leads to "krodha". You know. So, "kāma-krodha-parāyaṇāḥ". And then,
"īhante kāma-bhogārtham". So, for "kāma-bhogā". What do they do?
"anyāyenārtha-sañcayān". "anyāyena". So, actually, "kāma". It is said that,
"kā...", when "kāma" is, you know, unfulfilled, it leads to "krodha". When
"kāma" is there. You know. Say, "kāma" is here. Then, "kāma" is unfulfilled, it
leads to "krodha". When "kāma" is fulfilled, it leads to lobha. And the both
ways, it traps us. How is that? When we, when we have desires. And they are not
fulilled, then, you know, you know, you know, the anger comes up. And then, if I
cannot enjoy. Then, whatever, whoever has stopped me from enjoyment, I will
destroy that person. Or if I cannot destroy, then whatever is the object of
enjoyment, nobody should be able to enjoy it. You know. You know. You know. You
know. So, "kāma" leads to "krodha". When "kāma" is unfulfilled. And if "kāma" is
fulfilled, then it leads to lobha. Why? Because, and I want more. And more. And
more. So, say, when a man is attracted to a woman. And then, say, that
relationship somehow works out. They decide to develop a relationship. Then, the
man wants to please the woman. And so, therefore, he has to get gifts for,
rather, she then gives, demands. Give me this. Give me that. Give me that. And
then, that leads to lobha. We see Ajamila. He was a cultured brahmana. But then,
you know, you know, once he fell prey to the prostitute, then the result of that
was that "anyāyenārtha-sañcayān". He started doing violence. You know. For a
cultured brahmana, you know, to even speak a lie is, you know, considered to be
a great, great wrong. And the brahmana does not even do that. But Ajamila, what
was his re..., what was his, you know, plight? He was living, not just speaking
lies. But he was 15:22
