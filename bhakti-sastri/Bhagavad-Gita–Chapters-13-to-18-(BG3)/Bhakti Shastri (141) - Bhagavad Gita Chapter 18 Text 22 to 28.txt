    prapanna parijataya
    totra vetraika panaye
    jnana mudraya krishnaya
    gitamrita duhe namah

Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are
now in the heart of the 18th Chapter. We are discussing, you know, "jñānaṁ".
"karma". And "kartā". Within the three modes. So, in verses 21 and 22 of the
18th Chapter, we have discussed, you know, you know, "karma", you know, "jñānaṁ"
in goodness. And "jñānaṁ" in passion. We discussed in 20 and 21. So, let us move
forward to 22. Where it is "jñānaṁ", knowledge in ignorance. You know. This
seems to be a paradox of, you know, you know, content, knowledge and ignorance
are considered opposite. So, let us see what is this knowledge in ignorance.

        yat tu kṛtsna-vad ekasmin
        kārye saktam ahaitukam
        atattvārtha-vad alpaṁ ca
        tat tāmasam udāhṛtam

You know. You know. "yat tu kṛtsna-vad ekasmin". If "ekasmin". You know. There
is only one, you know, thing that is a reality of. So, to consider one part of
reality to be the totality of reality, that is knowledge in the mode of
ignorance. So, "kṛtsna-vad" means everything. So, to think of "ekasmin".
"ekasmin" is one thing. To think of one thing to be everything, that is, you
know, you know, "tat tāmasam udāhṛtam". So, that is first thing. One thing is
everything. What are the characteristics? "kārye saktam ahaitukam". "kārye
saktam". That means to become attached to one activity as if it is the totality.
As if it is everything. "ahaitukam". You know. The word "ahaitukam", you know,
is normally used in a positive sense to refer to bha..., you know, to
"ahaitukam" bhakti. That is how we use it. But here, "ahaitukam" refers to
causeless in the sense of being logicless. Senseless. So, it is not in the sense
of being transcendental. Or unmotivated. Or pure. It is in the sense of having
no rationale basis. Having no intelligent basis to things. "atattvārtha-vad
alpaṁ ca". "atattvārtha-vad". So, that, which does not have any
"tattvārtha-vad". That which does not have any, you know, you know, true meaning
to it. "tattvārtha". True meaning. You know. True meaning to it. "alpaṁ ca". And
that deals with a, only a, you know, part of reality. It only looks, it is
on..., it is meager knowledge. It is not complete knowledge. So, "tat tāmasam
udāhṛtam". That is knowledge in the mode of ignorance. Let us try to understand
this further. You know. So, Krishna is not, you know, calling specific things as
ignorance. Or knowledge in mode of ignorance. But He is giving the generic
characteristics. And depending on time, place, circumstance, depending on the
various different schools of thought that are present at different times. Some
of them will be, can be classified in goodness. Some in passion. And some in
ignorance. Now, here, you know, you know, Krishna, first of all, Krishna's, you
know, explanation is in terms of knowledge which makes one attached to one
fragment of reality. "ekasmin". "kār...", "ekasmin". "kārye saktam". That one
becomes it, too attached to one fragment of reality as if it is the complete
reality. "yat tu kṛtsna-vad ekasmin". "ekasmin". One thinks of one thing to be
complete. "kārye saktam ahaitukam". And one is too attached to things not
understanding that completeness. Not understanding their reality. Totality. So,
for example, we have materialism today. Materialism is, you know, widespread,
you know, school of thought. When materialism is often considered to be
progressive. People think that when we are becoming materialistic, they think
that, we are, you know, giv..., giving up the old fashion. Prescientific. You
know. Mythology based ideas of different religious dogmas. But, you know, you
know, what does materialism actually have as its end result? Materialism
essentially leads to, you know, assuming a part of reality, that is matter to be
the totality of reality. And it is obviously an incomplete part of reality. You
know. We are not matter based creatures. We are spirit based creatures. Matter
is something which is our outer covering. It is not our inner substance. So,
when we mistake the outer covering to be both, not to, not just outer. But also
inner. To be everything. Then, that leads to, you know, that leads to knowledge
in the mode of ignorance. So, what is this knowledge in the mode of ignorance?
So, it is knowledge, means, now, if we look at, there are many materialistic
thinkers. And in their own way, they are, you know, they have their own logic.
They have their own intellectual brilliance. And by that, they try to explain
things. But, you know, you know, the problem is, their vision is unidimensional.
They have reduced a polydimensional reality. That which is polydimensional.
Polydimensional means there are many aspects to reality. There is matter. There
is spirit. And there is the Supreme Lord. Who is the source of matter and
spirit. So, there are multiple aspects to reality. They have just taken one
aspect of it. And assumed it to be the totality of reality. And then, based on
this misconception, they try to analyse and explain how, you know, you know,
everything has come about. So, therefore, when a mother feels love for a child.
They try to explain. Or, you know, how it is nothing, but some secretion of
chemicals in the brain. And just because certain biochemicals are secreted in
the brain. That is how they try to explain emotions. And that is how these
reductionistic materialists, they try to explain everything in terms of matter.
So, you know, you know, Bhaktivinoda Thakur talks about such knowledge. You
know. That:

      jivake karaye gadha

So, he says that, such knowledge, what does it do? There is knowledge. But it
makes a person know better than an animal like a donkey. So, people work very
hard. And working hard itself is not bad. But working hard for a meaningful
purpose is desired. Not for a valueless pur..., not for something which is
not actually valuable. So, "yat tu kṛtsna-vad ekasmin". "ekasmin". One takes
only one aspect of reality. And assumes it to be the complete reality. "kārye
saktam ahaitukam". "kārye saktam". When one is attached. And one becomes, you
know, you know, without analogical basis. You know. Nobody has exp...,
demonstrated how, say, matter has, you know, led to the emergence of
consciousness. Nor has it been explained, you know, you know, theoretically
wha..., to any reasonable degree of satisfaction. And yet, that is assumed to be
the default way of looking at things today. You know. So, going back to
Bhaktivinoda Thakur's avidya..., "Vidyara Vilase" song. So, he says that:

        jaḍa-vidyā jata, māyāra vaibhava,
        tomāra bhajane bādhā

You know. "jaḍa-vidyā jata". "jaḍa-vidyā jata". "jaḍa" refers to matter. Which
is unconscious. Which i..., lacks in consciousness. So, it is called "jaḍa".
"jaḍa-vidyā jata, māyāra vaibhava,". That this is actually the opulence in
illusion. It is no actual opulence. It is false opulence. "jaḍa-vidyā jata,
māyāra vaibhava,". So, "māyāra vaibhava" means, suppose that person becomes a,
you know, billionaire in a dream. You know. The person is a billionaire. But it
is in a dream. Now, how long is it going to last? It is a "māyāra vaibhava". You
know. "māyā...". You know. But then, "jaḍa-vidyā jata, māyāra vaibhava,". You
know. You know. You know. "jīvake koraye gādhā". "tomāra bhajane bādhā". So, he
describes there are two consequences of it. What is it? "jīvake koraye gādhā".
That it makes a person live like a, the word is very strong. Donkey. It is a
very strong word. And, but it is used to indicate how the person's, you know,
functional as well as intellectual faculty is, are not used at a level mu...,
much higher than animals. And such kind of knowledge is "tomāra bhajane bādhā".
It is a "bādhā". It is to, obstacle. In worshipping Krishna. In devoting oneself
to Krishna. Because when one is not worshipping Krishna like this. Or when is,
when one is, you know, obsessed with material knowledge. And one thinks that
material knowledge contains a solution to all problems. Then, one does not feel
the need for God. And that is why it becomes a "tomāra bhajane bādhā". And we
see, you know, you know, you know, in the history of, you know, you know,
modern, say, modern intellectual history. Which is largely western history
nowadays. Because western, the European and then subsequent American, the
European thinkers, they, Europe..., Europe's civilisation spread all over the
world. Over, over a period of time. So, you know, you know, the European
thinkers, their thoughts spread all over the world, also, over a period of time.
So, "jīvake koraye gādhā". "tomāra bhajane bādhā". So, what happened is, in the
pursuit, conflict between science and religion, it was thought that science won.
Starting from the point when Galileo was thi..., Galileo, Copernicus, they, you
know, you know, they, you know, won the conflict against s..., you know, the
church. You know. Be, about the nature of the universe. Whether it is
heliocentric. Or geocentric. If we look at history from that point of view. What
happened is, most people thought that, you know, science has all the answers.
And science does not need God. And because of distant conceptions that science
has the answers. And science does not need God. The result was that many people
became enamoured by science. And that enamourment with material knowledge,
which, you know, you know, infatuation, material knowledge led to people giving
up God. So, "tomāra bhajane bādhā". And same way, what will happen is, the more
people turn away from, you know, turn, you know, get intoxicated with material
knowledge, the more they will feel the lack of necessity for God. But if people
keep acquiring material knowledge without getting infatuated by it, then as, you
know, there are several thinkers, like Pascal has said, a little of God, you
know, a little of science takes person away from God. But immersion in science
brings one back to God. So, there are quotes like this by various scientists,
also. And various thinkers. So, let us move forward. So, this is knowledge in
the mode of ignorance. Where one assumes a fragment of reality to be the
totality of reality. So, basically, when Krishna is analysing this way, you
know, the essence, the thrust of his argument is, do not live in ignorance. Try
to live in goodness. So, let us look at the next verse. You know. "yat tu
kṛtsna-vad ekasmin". So, this 18.23.

        niyataṁ saṅga-rahitam
        arāga-dveṣataḥ kṛtam
        aphala-prepsunā karma
        yat tat sāttvikam ucyate

So, "niyataṁ saṅga-rahitam". So, what is He talking about? "sāttvikam", "karma".
So, "karma" and "sāttvikam" comes in the last two lines. So, He is talking now
about "jñānaṁ karma ca kartā ca". That is what was mentioned in the 19th verse.
You know. Three things, Krishna will be talking about. So, 19.22, you know, so,
20, 21, 22 talked about "jñānaṁ". Now, 23 to 25 will talk about "karma". So,
this talk, this verse will talk about "karma" in the mode of goodness. So,
"niyataṁ saṅga-rahitam". "niyataṁ" means that which is prescribed by scripture.
"saṅga-rahitam". "saṅga-rahitam" means that which is done without any
attachment. You know. "arāga-dveṣataḥ kṛtam". "arāga-dveṣataḥ". When one does
not have attachment. And one does not have aversion. "aphala-prepsunā karma".
"aphala-prepsunā" means that without any att..., atta..., without the motivation
of the fruit of the result. "yat tat sāttvikam ucyate". So, we will see this,
you know, consistent theme. You know. The Gita. That as long as we are attached
to the fruit of work, to the extent we cannot think about the transcendental
reality which exists beyond the realm of action. And its fruit. So, that is why
Krishna wants us to rai..., raise our consciousness to spiritual reality. And
that is why He repeatedly urges us to not be attached to material fruits.
Because material fruits will bind us in material existence. So, "arāga-dveṣataḥ
kṛtam". Without any attachment or aver..., aversion. Now, in 18.24, Krishna will
talk about action in the mode of passion. You know. You know.

        yat tu kāmepsunā karma
        sāhaṅkāreṇa vā punaḥ
        kriyate bahulāyāsaṁ
        tad rājasam udāhṛtam

So, "rājasam udāhṛtam". That is in the mode of passion. What is it? "yat tu
kāmepsunā karma". "kāmepsunā". The work which is done with the desire, with
worldly desires. So, "kāmepsunā". One, when one has "kāma" for the, you know,
fruits of the work. And "sāhaṅkāreṇa vā punaḥ". "ha...", "ahaṅkāra". You know.
"ahaṅkāra" means, you know, arr..., arrogance. There are thinkers thinking that
I am the doer. So:

        yasya nāhaṅkṛto bhāvo
        buddhir yasya na lipyate

A few verses earlier, Krishna has talked about in 15..., in 18.16-17 that one
who has "nāhaṅkṛto bhāvo". One who does not have any "ahaṅkār", that person will
not be bound. But now, He is talking about "sāhaṅkāreṇa vā punaḥ". When the
person has "ahaṅkār". "kriyate bahulāyāsaṁ". "bahula". "bahula" means after
great trouble, that is involving severe labor. So, this is referring to ugra
karma. You know. "kriyate bahulāyāsaṁ". "bahulāyāsaṁ". So, you know, you know,
ugra karma can be in passion. Ugra karma can also be in ignorance. It depends on
what, you know, the specific activity. And the consciousness in which that
activity is done. So, "kriyate bahulāyāsaṁ". "bahulāyāsaṁ". So, actually, the
work in, which is in the passion. And which is in ignorance, it is not the same.
But many times, that which is, which is in passion, goes down to ignorance after
some time. So:

        kriyate bahulāyāsaṁ
        tad rājasam udāhṛtam

You know. In the Amritu Manthan Lila, which is described in the Eighth Canto of
Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, you know, the demons, and the demigods, both make a truth so
that they can churn the milk ocean. So, when they are about to churn the milk
ocean. At that time, they find that each of them, they, they, both of them want
to hold onto the, you know, you know, head. You know. And not the tail. Because
the idea is, they think the head is a more honorable part of the snake "Vāsuki".
And the tail is a, you know, is not an honorable part. So, they both want to
hold onto the head. And not the tail. You know. And the Lord, cons..., Lord, you
know, sees the obstinacy, the stubbornness of the, you know, you know, asuras.
And agrees to let them hold the head. And they first re..., rebel against the
Lord's allocating them the tail. And the Lord ackno..., allows them to hold the
head. And then, what happens? When "Vāsuki" is being pulled, as he uses a rope
to churn the milk ocean, at that time, from his mou..., mouth, poisons flames
start coming out. And those flames scorch and torment the demons. So, the demons
work hard. Prabhupada writes in the purports over there. Demons work very hard.
Without profit even to themselves. Without profit even to themselves. That means
they work without gaining anything all. You know. Either for themselves. Or of
course for others. They did not benefit the devatas. And they did not benefit
themselves. As they had to trouble themselves. So, "kriyate bahulāyāsaṁ". So,
often, work in the mode of passion, you know. one feels dragged to do more. And
more. And more. And one never feels satisfied, no matter how much one does. No
matter how much one does, one feels, oh, I am not satisfied. May..., I am not
satisfied. I want something more. I want something more. And one never gets
satisfied that way. So:

        kriyate bahulāyāsaṁ
        tad rājasam udāhṛtam

Now, after describing this, you know, Krishna moves forward. And then:

        anubandhaṁ kṣayaṁ hiṁsām
        anapekṣya ca pauruṣam
        mohād ārabhyate karma
        yat tat tāmasam ucyate

So, "anubandhaṁ kṣayaṁ hiṁsām". "anubandhaṁ kṣayaṁ hiṁsām". That, you know, that
kind of, now, Krishna is talking about work in the mode of ignorance here.
"anubandhaṁ". That which causes bondage. Now, all work causes bondage. But mode
in ignorance, it is especially. And excruciatingly binding of him. Just like,
there are addictions. You know. The addictions, they are like vicious bindings.
Which people just find very difficult to break through. "kṣayaṁ hiṁsām".
"kṣayaṁ" is, you know, violence. Destruction. "akṣayaṁ" is the opposite. That
which is not destructible. "kṣayaṁ". So, when people, for example, terrorism,
vandalism, all these are actions in the mode of ignorance. "kṣayaṁ". "kṣayaṁ" is
destruction. "hiṁsām" is violence. So, now, we may wonder what is the difference
between "kṣayaṁ" and "hiṁsām". Both seem to be similar. So, generally speaking,
you know, you know, "kṣayaṁ" refers to things. And "hiṁsām" refers to people.
You know. We talk about "ahiṁsām". "ahiṁsām" means nonviolence. So, nonviolence,
we generally, we talk about against people. You know. When peop..., somebody
hits peop..., others. Somebody attacks others. Brutalises others. That is
peop..., considered a violent person. And destructive is often with respect to
things. Somebody gets angry. And, you know, punches a, you know, fist on the
table. And cracks the table. Or throws things. And breaks them. So, "anubandhaṁ
kṣayaṁ hiṁsām". So, in mode of passion, mode of ignorance, either one is
violent. Against people. Or viol..., destructive towards things. So, this is a
very self-defeating kind of action. "anapekṣya ca pauruṣam". So, "anapekṣya".
Now, we will see that words can have different meanings depending on their
context. You know. You know. So, the words may sound similar. But they may have,
you know, no similarity in their meaning, actually. So, "anapekṣaḥ śucir dakṣa".
So, in the qualities of a devotee which are mentioned in the 12th Chapter of the
Gita. "anapekṣaḥ". "anapekṣaḥ" is referred to as a devotee who does not have,
who does not have expectations from other things. But whereas, here, the word
"anapekṣya", that is used, is, is not in terms of expectation. But is in terms
of consideration. One is so reckless. One is so foolhardy. That one does not
think about consequences. One acts, you know, care..., recklessly.
Self-destructibly. So, "anapekṣya ca pauruṣam". "pauruṣam". "pauruṣam", you
know, so, "pauruṣam" here refers to harshness. Harshness means, you know, in
terms of speech. The person is, is not sensitive. The person is monstrously
insensitive. And speaks bad words. Uses foul language. And also, you know,
speak, and thinks that to speak insultingly, you know, is, you know, you know,
it is, as if it is, it is something very intelligent. The sign of cleverness.
You know. Sometimes, people make a parody of things. Parody means, you know,
they make a caricature. They car..., they imitate in a mocking way. And by that,
they try to prove how, you know, you know, actually, whatever is being told, is
not correct. And, but they rather than doing constructive criticism, they do
destructive criticism. And destructive criticism means their goal is not to
improve upon what another person has suggested. Their goal is to, you know,
destroy the person's idea. And destroy the person's morale, also. So, that is
ha..., you know, "pauruṣam". And, you know, this is often, this is often seen
as a sign, unfortunately, in some circles, it is seen as cle..., sign of
cleverness. You know. The more, more stingingly a person can taunt somebody
else. You know. The cleverer that person is, so, considered. Oh. What a taunt
you have made. What a cir..., what a comment you made. Actually, this is not a
sign of cleverness. Of course, it may require cleverness to come up with taunts.
But, you know, the point is that, you know, when one speaks in a way that hurts
others. And one delights in the hurt that one is causing. Then, that is tamasic.
You know. You know. Actually, the pure devotee is ready to take up suffering so
that, you know, you know, others can become free from suffering.
"para-dukha-dukhi". Pure devotees are, they consider the, you know, they become,
you know, unhappy when they see others unhappy. And they want to relieve others
in happiness. And for that purpose, they are ready to take up anxiety upon
themselves. As contrasted in very tragically perverted ways that those who
consider, you know, you know, you know, that by causing pain to others, I will
get pleasure. So, this is "mohād ārabhyate karma". "mohād ārabhyate". So,
"pauruṣam", it can mean harshness. You know. You know. Prabhupada translates
over here, also, as self-sanctioned. You know. The word "pauruṣam", you know,
you know, you know, you know, you know, can also:

        dambho darpo ’bhimānaś ca
        krodhaḥ pāruṣyam eva ca

So, there was a similar word in, in the, while describing the qualities of the
demoniac. In 16.4. "krodhaḥ pāruṣyam". "pāruṣyam". is harshness. So, here,
Prabhupada refers to "pauruṣam". So, again, it is a similar-sounding word.
Prabhupada translates it self-sanctioned. Self-sanctioned means, you know, one
t..., imagines that one can do it because one is, one is clever enough. Whatever
I feel like doing, I will do it. Because ultimately, it is my life. I can choose
whatever I want to do. So, "pauruṣam". And "mohād ārabhyate". We had discussed
earlier, what is the word, "mohāt" is very common with, when describing the mode
of ignorance. Even while describing renunciation in the three modes. In this, in
the start of this chapter itself. Krishna talks about "mohāt tasya parityāgas".
That when one does tre..., the, "tyāgaḥ" because of "mohāt". That is considered
to be in the mode of ignorance. You know. "yat tat tāmasam ucyate". That is
"tāmasam". That is in the mode of ignorance. Then, you know, Krishna moves
forward to the next verse. You know. Krishna. Let us discuss what Krishna is
talking about now. So, now, He is talking about "kartā". The three types of
"kartā" in the next three verses. 26. 27. 28.

        mukta-saṅgo ’nahaṁ-vādī
        dhṛty-utsāha-samanvitaḥ
        siddhy-asiddhyor nirvikāraḥ
        kartā sāttvika ucyate

So, "mukta-saṅgo ’nahaṁ-vādī". So, here, there is "mukta-saṅgaḥ". One is not
attached to one's, one's own activities. You know. You know. The, one is not
attached to the fruits of the activities. One is liberated from that attachment
to the fruits. And "’nahaṁ-vādī". One does not imagine oneself to be the doer.
One understand that whatever success comes about, there are multiple factors
involved in that success. And I am alone not the doer.
"dhṛty-utsāha-samanvitaḥ". "dhṛty-utsāha". So, there is, "samanvitaḥ" means
imbued with. Permeated with. You know. Com..., you know, filled with. Prabhupada
says. Qualified with. "dhṛty-utsāha". Determination. And enthusiasm. You know.
So, we have discussed this earlier, you know, you know, when we discussed
"utsāhān niścayād dhairyāt". In our discussion of the Upadesamrta. When we were
talking about the factors that are favorable. And the factors that are
unfavorable. So, "dhṛty-utsāha-samanvitaḥ". So, actually, when there is
enthusiasm without, you know, you know, patience. You know. B..., actually, you
know, what a dev..., what a person needs to make a long-term progress is
enthusiasm. And determination. Just like if I have, a person has to go on a
long, one has to go cross-countries, say. One has to go from, by car, from here
to Calcutta. Maybe, it is a fifty-hour journey. Or a four, thirty-hour journey.
Whatever. Long journey, it is. Then, one has to go on a long journey. One has to
have determination. But along with that, one has to have enthusiasm, also. If
one does not have enthusiasm, then one will not embark on this journey, only.
And even if one has enthusiasm, one will not be able to sustain that enthusiasm
if one does not have determination. So, in goodness, one has enthusiasm. And
determination. "dhṛty-utsāha-samanvitaḥ". So, sometimes, people think of, you
know, goodness as very bor..., life in goodness is very boring life. You know.
You know. We think of life in goodness as a life in slow motion. Life in slow
motion means, we think that, ok, you know, because I am in goodness, I have to
do everything slowly. You know. I should not speak fast. May..., I should not
run fast. I should not do activities fast. Slow. Slow. Slow. Well, slowness is
not necessarily a defining characteristic of the mode of goodness. In the mode
of goodness, the defining characteristic is 27:02
