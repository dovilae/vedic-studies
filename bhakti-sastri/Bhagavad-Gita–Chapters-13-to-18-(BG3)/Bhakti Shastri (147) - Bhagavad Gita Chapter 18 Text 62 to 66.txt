    prapanna parijataya
    totra vetraika panaye
    jnana mudraya krishnaya
    gitamrita duhe namah

Hare Krishna. Welcome back to the Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are
now coming to the concluding sections of the Bhagavad Gita. Or concluding verses
of the Bhagavad Gita. So, in the previous class, we discussed about how, you
know, we can, we, if do not act according to Krishna's direction, Krishna is
telling in 18.58. Act according to My consciousness. "mac-cittaḥ sarva-durgāṇi".
If we do not, then, "niyok...", you know, then "vinaṅkṣyasi". You will be lost.
And how will we be lost? That is described in 59 and 60. He says that, "prakṛtis
tvāṁ niyokṣ...", "niyokṣyati". And then, you know, you know, material nature,
you will be forced to act according to the material nature. Because we are, you
know, you know, we are, to a large extent, you know, forced to act according to
our nature. And then, as a means to go beyond material nature, Krishna talks
about how He is the controller of material nature. 18.61. So, in the Vedic
sch..., you know, school, Vedic analysis, there is a school of thought called as
"Svabhāvavāda". You know. "Svabhāvavāda" means, our "svabhāva" is supreme. Like
we have mayavada. That means every, everything is maya. Brahmavada. Everything
is Brahman. "Svabhāvavāda" is argument. Or a school of thought that presents a
paticular arg..., you know, so, "Svabhāvavāda" means the school of thought that
present the argument that, you know, everything is controlled by "svabhāva". So,
Krishna has told in the 61st verse that He is the controller. Who is present in
all bodies. Which are made of maya.

        īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
        hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati
        bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni
        yantrārūḍhāni māyayā

So, He is saying that He is in control of the bodies. He is in control of the
living entities, also. So, how is that knowledge important? That will be
discussed in this verse now. Krishna will describe how, you know, we can turn
towards Him. You know. And so:

        tam eva śaraṇaṁ gaccha
        sarva-bhāvena bhārata
        tat-prasādāt parāṁ śāntiṁ
        sthānaṁ prāpsyasi śāśvatam

So, "tam eva śaraṇaṁ gaccha". Oh, Krishna. Krishna is telling Arjuna. Surrender
unto "tam eva". That Supreme Lord. So, here, also, because now Krishna is, you
know, progressively revealing the knowledge. So, He i..., He is, after talking
about surrender, He has gone down to material nature. And then, from material
nature, He first comes to Paramatma. And then, He will come to Bhagavan. So,
often, when Krishna refers to the Paramatma, He refers to Himself in the third
person. That is why He is referring, to that Supersoul, please surrender.

        tam eva śaraṇaṁ gaccha
        sarva-bhāvena bhārata

"sarva-bhāvena". Whole-heartedly. "gacch...", just completely surrender. So, you
know, you know, so, "sthā...", "sarva-bhāvena" has come earlier, also, in the
Bhagavad Gita. You know. You know. Especially, in 15.19, when Krishna has, when
one, Krishna says that, when one understands that Krishna is supreme.

        yo mām evam asammūḍho
        jānāti puruṣottamam
        sa sarva-vid bhajati māṁ
        sarva-bhāvena bhārata


"sarva-bhāvena". Complete, it, with all the emotions of the heart. That means,
you know, whole-heartedly. Complete love we offer to Krishna. So, Krishna is
telling, you know, surrender to that Supreme Lord, whole-heartedly. And then,
what happens? "tat-prasādāt". By His mercy, the reference to "prasād" is coming
again now. It has come earlier in, 15..., 18.58. You know.

        mac-cittaḥ sarva-durgāṇi
        mat-prasādāt tariṣyasi

So, same point that you can go ob..., beyond, obstacles by the mercy of the
Supreme Lord. By My mercy. And now, Krishna is saying, by My..., the mercy of
the, you know, of that Being who is situated in the hearts of everyone. You
know. "tat-prasādāt". What will happen? "parāṁ śāntiṁ". The supreme peace.
"sthānaṁ prāpsyasi śāśvatam". 04:15
