    prapanna parijataya
    totra vetraika panaye
    jnana mudraya krishnaya
    gitamrita duhe namah

Hare Krishna. Welcome back to the Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are
now coming to the concluding sections of the Bhagavad Gita. Or concluding verses
of the Bhagavad Gita. So, in the previous class, we discussed about how, you
know, we can, we, if do not act according to Krishna's direction, Krishna is
telling in 18.58. Act according to My consciousness. "mac-cittaḥ sarva-durgāṇi".
If we do not, then, "niyok...", you know, then "vinaṅkṣyasi". You will be lost.
And how will we be lost? That is described in 59 and 60. He says that, "prakṛtis
tvāṁ niyokṣ...", "niyokṣyati". And then, you know, you know, material nature,
you will be forced to act according to the material nature. Because we are, you
know, you know, we are, to a large extent, you know, forced to act according to
our nature. And then, as a means to go beyond material nature, Krishna talks
about how He is the controller of material nature. 18.61. So, in the Vedic
sch..., you know, school, Vedic analysis, there is a school of thought called as
"Svabhāvavāda". You know. "Svabhāvavāda" means, our "svabhāva" is supreme. Like
we have mayavada. That means every, everything is maya. Brahmavada. Everything
is Brahman. "Svabhāvavāda" is argument. Or a school of thought that presents a
paticular arg..., you know, so, "Svabhāvavāda" means the school of thought that
present the argument that, you know, everything is controlled by "svabhāva". So,
Krishna has told in the 61st verse that He is the controller. Who is present in
all bodies. Which are made of maya.

        īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
        hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati
        bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni
        yantrārūḍhāni māyayā

So, He is saying that He is in control of the bodies. He is in control of the
living entities, also. So, how is that knowledge important? That will be
discussed in this verse now. Krishna will describe how, you know, we can turn
towards Him. You know. And so:

        tam eva śaraṇaṁ gaccha
        sarva-bhāvena bhārata
        tat-prasādāt parāṁ śāntiṁ
        sthānaṁ prāpsyasi śāśvatam

So, "tam eva śaraṇaṁ gaccha". Oh, Krishna. Krishna is telling Arjuna. Surrender
unto "tam eva". That Supreme Lord. So, here, also, because now Krishna is, you
know, progressively revealing the knowledge. So, He i..., He is, after talking
about surrender, He has gone down to material nature. And then, from material
nature, He first comes to Paramatma. And then, He will come to Bhagavan. So,
often, when Krishna refers to the Paramatma, He refers to Himself in the third
person. That is why He is referring, to that Supersoul, please surrender.

        tam eva śaraṇaṁ gaccha
        sarva-bhāvena bhārata

"sarva-bhāvena". Whole-heartedly. "gacch...", just completely surrender. So, you
know, you know, so, "sthā...", "sarva-bhāvena" has come earlier, also, in the
Bhagavad Gita. You know. You know. Especially, in 15.19, when Krishna has, when
one, Krishna says that, when one understands that Krishna is supreme.

        yo mām evam asammūḍho
        jānāti puruṣottamam
        sa sarva-vid bhajati māṁ
        sarva-bhāvena bhārata


"sarva-bhāvena". Complete, it, with all the emotions of the heart. That means,
you know, whole-heartedly. Complete love we offer to Krishna. So, Krishna is
telling, you know, surrender to that Supreme Lord, whole-heartedly. And then,
what happens? "tat-prasādāt". By His mercy, the reference to "prasād" is coming
again now. It has come earlier in, 15..., 18.58. You know.

        mac-cittaḥ sarva-durgāṇi
        mat-prasādāt tariṣyasi

So, same point that you can go ob..., beyond, obstacles by the mercy of the
Supreme Lord. By My mercy. And now, Krishna is saying, by My..., the mercy of
the, you know, of that Being who is situated in the hearts of everyone. You
know. "tat-prasādāt". What will happen? "parāṁ śāntiṁ". The supreme peace.
"sthānaṁ prāpsyasi śāśvatam". And along with that, you will get a "śāśvatam",
"sthānaṁ". You will get an eternal resting place. Eternal destination. So, in
material nature, as long as we are situated, we cannot have any eternal
destination. Whatever destination we have will be temporary. If you want an
eternal destination, we need to, you know, you know, to take shelter of the Supreme
Lord. Because He is the controller of material nature. He is the master of
material nature. And, you know, He can control material nature. And He can take
us beyond the reach of material nature, also. So, let us look at this "parāṁ
śāntiṁ". So, there is "śāntiṁ". You know. Now, "śāntiṁ" refers to peace. So,
immedia..., in the immediate battlefield context, it may refer to that, you
know, ok, you know, there will be no violence. There will be no war. There will
be peace. But Krishna is not talking about that kind of peace. You know. There
is "parāṁ śāntiṁ". There is a supreme peace. So, what is the supreme peace? You
know. There is a peace of the mind. And there is the peace of the heart. You
know. So, peace of the mind. And peace of the heart. What is the difference
between the two? Yeah. So, you know, you know, peace of the mind means that, ok,
at the mental level, there are no anxieties. Or troubles. When we go, say, to a
scenic place. And there is nice, calm atmosphere. Soothing wind. You know. And
we feel very relaxed. And peaceful. That is peace of the mind. But peace of the
heart is something which is different. It is the peace that comes from loving.
And being loved. You know. Now, when we love, and we are loved, at that time,
there is, no doubt, anxiety for the beloved. You know. But still, there is great
satisfaction. You know. So, the Bible also talks about this. That, actually, one
can have, now, the peace that "passeth all understanding". You know. By knowing
God. By surrendering to God. By loving God. The pea..., so, "passeth all
understanding". That means that peace cannot be experienced materi..., at the
material level of reality. At the material level of reality, we think of peace
only in terms of lack of anxiety. And agitation. Externally. Or internally. But
the supreme peace is, you know, that it which is not look like as peace
externally. It looks like anxiety. It looks like agitation. But, you know, it is
peace. Because the heart is satisfied. The heart rests in joy. You know. That
is what is, that is what we long for, actually, all. Even if we do not realise
it, that is what we are all longing for. Now, when Krishna talks about this kind
of peace, so, Arjuna, when he is fighting the war, he has to choose between, you
know, "śāntiṁ". And "sthānaṁ". You know. If he wants "sthānaṁ". "sthānaṁ" is a
resting place. That can refer to a kingdom. So, Arjuna has to choose if he
fights. If he win..., and wins, then he will get "sthānaṁ". He will get a
kingdom. But then, even he gets s..., "sthānaṁ", he will not get "śāntiṁ".
Because he will have to fight for that. On the other hand, if he wants "śāntiṁ",
you know, then he will have to sacrifice "sthānaṁ". You know. You know. You
know. So, Krishna is telling that, actually, if you surrender to Me, you will
get both. You know.

So, if we our, without surrendering, Arjuna acts, independently, then he will
get only one of them. But here, Krishna is telling, if you surrender to me, you
will get both. And how will you get both? You will get both in the best possible
way. Best possible way means, "parāṁ śāntiṁ". And "śāśvatam", "sthānaṁ". So,
supreme peace. The peace that will never be disturbed. Once, we return to
Krishna. And love Krishna. The, in the, and lo..., lo..., you know, live a life
of love for Krishna in the spiritual world, then there is, nothing can, that can
disrupt, you know, or destroy that love. And that life which we have got with
Krishna. Nothing. Nothing can destroy that. And similarly, you know, you know,
in this world, when we get a "śā...", "sthānaṁ", nothing is permanent. I may
have a kingdom for some time. But then, some, I may have, now, nowadays, people
hardly think about kingdoms. People think about just some, some flats. You know.
I have some, maybe I have some square feet flat. Or maybe some, if, you know,
some people are wealthy, may have row houses. Or bungalows. Maybe, a few people
have villas. But practically, very, you know, practically, nobody is able to
think in terms of kingdoms nowadays. But even if I have a kingdom, still, that
kingdom is also temporary. So, it is "aśāśvatam". And there, and even, at the
most, as long as I am alive, I can be the king. Mo..., quite often, even when I
am alive, there may be some cope. Somebody, there may be upraising. And I may be
usurped. And sometimes, if the king is overthrown, the king may be killed
ruthlessly. Or king may be imprisoned. Or king may be exiled. Exiled. And then,
you know, you know, all the power, and privilege, the king had enjoyed,
everything gets lost. Just a, you know, and it is, that is terrible humiliation
that happens. For the king who was ruling in glory. And now has to, you know,
flee in fear. So, that is the plight of the material existence. So, beyond this
plight of material existence, there is transcendental existence. And in that
transcendental existence, you know, there is the supreme reality. The supreme
reality is that, we are eternally meant to love Krishna. And rejoice in that
happiness. So, Krishna is telling, by surrender to the Supreme Lord, he will get
both. He will get "sthānaṁ". He will get the "parāṁ", "sthānaṁ". And, sorry,
"śāśvatam", "sthānaṁ". And "parāṁ śāntiṁ". So, now, after describing this, what
does this mean practically in terms of surrender? So, we will discuss about
surrender a little later. "tam eva śaraṇaṁ gaccha". You know. But, you know, you
know, here, the important point is that, you know, we all have to recognise that
we have to serve Krishna according to our nature. So, let us move back. So, what
is happening in this chapter? See, you know, you know, I will come back to this
later. Yeah. So, you know, Chapter 18, how is the progression going? The gradual
way is karma yog..., karma kanda. Jnana kanda. And then, moksha. You know.
Ultimately, leads to moksha. Moksha was:

        brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
        na śocati na kāṅkṣati

Then, Krishna talked about rapid way, "cetasā...":

        sarva-karmāṇy api sadā
        kurvāṇo mad-vyapāśrayaḥ

So, from that point of 56 to 58. Now, if do not follow the gradual path. Or the
rapid path. One will get lost. Now, we, if one is not to get lost, Krishna will
now, you know, try to talk, will talk about coming to the higher level directly.
So, first, He talks about surrender to Supersoul. And then, He will talk about
surrender to the Supreme Lord. You know. You know. So, now, here, a question
comes up, you know, what do we do accor..., do we, how do we, in Kali yuga,
discover our nature? And how do we serve according to our nature? So, in
general, the important thing to recognise is that, all of us, you know, have a
nature. But it is not necessary that the nature will be, you know, nature will
be uni..., will be only one kind of nature. That means, that, yes, if a brahmana
and a brahmani unite, then it is quite likely that the son who is born, a child,
who is born, may be a brahmana. But now, there have been, you know, may, there
have been practically generations. Generations of unions which have been of
different varanas. And thereby, the resulting is that, people who are born, they
often have a mixture of various varanas. They, of course, one varana is
predominant. But still, you know, the important point i..., is not to sort of,
you know, you know, try to go into a, you know, parallelising analysis.
Parallelising analysis means, one thinks of, just so much analysis one does,
that there is paralysis by analysis. No. One does not need for that. What one
focuses on is using one's, you know, intelligence to find out what is the
activity, you know, in which we are externally competent. And internally
comfortable. And then, we do that activity. So, generally, in our devotional
life, there will be some activities which we like to do. Some activities which
we do not mind doing. And some activities we just, you know, can barely tolerate
doing. We just cannot, you know, we just feel that, if I can avoid it, it will
be very good. So, that will vary. So, general, the activities which we like to
do, we gain strength from those activities. The activities which we do not like
to do, we have to expend strength to do those activities. That we fight against
ourselves to do those activities. But either way, by doing the activities that
we are to do, you know, which we do, we can gradually grow towards Krishna if we
choose that intelligently. So, in general, we have to have some activities which
we like to do. And they give us strength and inspiration. And they help us, they
make spiritual life joyful even at our level. And then, afterwards, when we
become purified, then we are not so much controlled by our material nature.
Then, whatever we want to do, we can do for Krishna's sake. And we get joy in
that. Of course, even pure devotees have their individuality. And their
individuality, you know, you know, is such that it pleases Krishna. So, if we
look at the pastimes of, intimate pastimes of Krishna with His gopas and gopis
that is descr..., that is described. You know. They all got, every gopa and gopi
has, you know, his or her own individual nature. And their nature, and their
service according to the nature pleases Krishna. So, there is spiritual
individuality, we are not talking about that right now. We are talking about our
material nature. Our material individuality. Which has to be purified and
elevated.

So, which has to, when we, how do we purify our material individuality? By
making, you know, you know, by, you know, we purify our material individuality
by, you know, engaging in service in a proper way. So, we do not have to re...,
the, our material nature does not require rejection. Or repression. Rejection
means imagining that, oh, I do not have this nature, only. And repression means
ok, I have, but I try to curb it. Curb it. Curb it. That will also not work.
There has to be expression. And direction. I have to express my material nature.
If I have a brahmanical nature, I have to act as a brahmana. But then, there has
to be direction. As a brahmana, I may want, I may want to read all kinds of
books. But no, we should study scri..., primarily scripture. And books that help
us to understand scripture. And then, we, you know, you know, you know, then,
so, there is direction required. So, in this way, when we talk about "śaraṇaṁ".
So, when we, we can, talking about surrender to the Absolute Truth, that does
not necessarily mean giving up everything material. It simply means that we, you
know, take His guidance about how best to serve Kri..., Him. So, the principle
of varnashram dharma is, you know, to help us surrender to the Supreme Lord. So,
varnashram dharma offers us a particular way by which we can gradually surrender
to the Supreme Lord. So, that is within Vedic varnashram at a gradual. And
"daivi varṇāśrama", it is rapid. Vedic varnashram is, one primarily acts
according to one's varna. In Vedic, in "daivi varṇāśrama", one acts according
to, you know, one acts primarily as a vaishnava, so, as soon, vaishnava,
vaishnavi, serving Krishna. And within that, one chooses how best one can serve
Krishna as per time, place, circumstance. So, as per, and of course, not just
time, place, circumstance. According to one's "svabhāva", also. So, you know,
the primary focus in, in "daivi varṇāśrama" is that ok, I am a soul. I have an
eternal relationship with Krishna. I am meant to serve Krishna. But how I will
serve Krishna? That will vary according to time, place, circumstance. So, now,
here, Krishna tells that, now, in this way, you should surrender. You know. He
says surrender. Now, after describing surrender, then what happens next? Let us
look at it. Yes. Yeah. "iti te". You know. So, 18.63 we come to now.

        iti te jñānam ākhyātaṁ
        guhyād guhya-taraṁ mayā
        vimṛśyaitad aśeṣeṇa
        yathecchasi tathā kuru

So, "iti te jñānam ākhyātaṁ". I have spoken this. And what kind of knowledge is
this? "guhyād guhya-taraṁ mayā". "guhyād" is "guhya". Confidential.
"guhya-taraṁ". It is confidential. And more confidential, also. That is "guhyād
guhya-taraṁ". So, there is good, better, best. So, like that, the superlative.
So, this is second level. There is more confidential knowledge. Now, after,
con..., telling this confidential knowledge, what is, what should Arjuna do?
"vimṛśyaitad aśeṣeṇa". "vimṛśyaitad". Immersion. Immersion on means absorption.
Contemplation. Serious intellectual, you know, thought about it. You know. The
world often uses intellection. Intellectual contemplation, you know, is called
intellection or mentation. Not meditation. Mentation. Mentation means
contemplation. So, "vimṛśyaitad aśeṣeṇa". "aśeṣeṇa". And, meditate thoroughly.
Con..., think seriously. Deliberate deeply. Do not leave any stone under. You
know. Deliberate. "vimṛśyaitad aśeṣeṇa". And then, after that, "yathecchasi
tathā kuru". "yathā". "icchasi". As is your desire, you know, "tathā kuru". You
know. So, you can act. So, here, we see, the Bhagavad Gita, as I said earlier,
it does not hand down commandments. It gives choices. So, the Bhagavad Gita is
telling us, you know, telling Arjuna over here. And through Arjuna, all of us,
that, you know, you know, act for the pleasure of Krishna. That, you know, that
is what Bhagavad Gita's message is. But it does not, you know, it is that, act
for the pleasure of Krishna is, indirectly mentioned in the previous verse. "tam
eva śaraṇaṁ gaccha". But the Bhagavad Gita does not impose this message
dogmatically. What does it say? You know. It says, ok, this is what I told you.
If it makes sense, now, act accordingly. If it does not make sense, then you
have the free will. You can choose how you want to act. So, that freedom,
Krishna never takes away from us. Krishna always may give, offers a freedom of
how we should act. So, we always have free will. And the whole purpose of
Krishna is to guide us how to use our free will properly. Just like, you know,
if a small child, you know, somehow finds a, say, thousand rupee note. Then,
child finds a thousand, the child, child may not even understand what is value.
Now, with the thousand rupee notes, the child can get so many valuable things.
But child may think that, oh, thousand, I, what, the child thinks is valuable
is, maybe one chocolate. Now, chocolate may be worth just two rupees or five
rupees. You know. But the child may just give away those thousand rupees for the
sake of a two rupee or a five rupee worth object. Then, the parent does not want
to take away the thousand rupees from the child. But if the child has a thousand
rupees, the parent wants to guide. See, this is so valuable. Use it properly.
Then, you will get much more. So, similarly, we, Krishna gives us directions.
The purpose of Krishna's directions is not to deprive us of our freedom. But to
ensure that our, you know, you know, that we do not deprive ourselves in the
name of freedom. You know. What does it mean? Not deprive us of our freedom. But
we do not deprive ourselves in the name of freedom. Now, the child may say, I
want to be free. And in the name of freedom, the child may actually just
underutilise a thousand rupee object. A thou..., a thousand rupee note for just,
the, you know, you know, a few rupees, worth of ob..., objects. So, therefore,
in the name of freedom, child may say, I want to be free. But in the name of
freedom, the child will deprive him, himself or herself. Because the child does
not understand the value. Similarly, we have got the human form of life. And the
human form of life is, you know, "su-labhaṁ su-durlabhaṁ". "su-labhaṁ".
Actually, we, we do not know pray in a lower specy that I get a human form of
life. We just get it. That is Krishna's mercy. When we get the human form of
life, "su-labhaṁ su-durlabhaṁ". So, you know, you know, this human form of life
is "su-durlabhaṁ". It is very rare. And, "lab...", you know:

        labdhvā su-durlabham idaṁ bahu-sambhavānte
        mānuṣyam artha-dam anityam apīha dhīraḥ

"mānuṣyam artha-dam". It is temporary. But "artha-dam". It is truly valuable. It
can grant us. That is, that which is just truly "artha-pūrṇa". That is what?
"artha". What is our "artha"? That is the "paramārtha". The supreme "artha". We
can get eternal happiness through this. So, therefore:

        tūrṇaṁ yateta na pated anu-mṛtyu yāvan
        niḥśreyasāya viṣayaḥ khalu sarvataḥ syāt

So, "tūrṇaṁ yateta". You know. Endeavor immediately. "tūrṇaṁ yateta na pated
anu-mṛtyu yāvan". "na pated". Befo..., the "na pated". "a na pated". Immediately
endeavor before this body falls. And this body is capable of falling at any
time. "anu-mṛtyu yāvan". It can fall at any time. And therefore, you know, when
we have to endeavor, "viṣayaḥ khalu sarvataḥ syāt". "niḥśreyasāya". Endeavor for
transcendence. Endeavor for eternal existence. "viṣayaḥ khalu sarvataḥ syāt".
"viṣayaḥ" can be got everywhere. So, you know, you know, now, essentially again,
the point which we are discussing is:

        vimṛśyaitad aśeṣeṇa
        yathecchasi tathā kuru

Deliberate. And then, decide what is to be, what you want to do. Act
accordingly. Act according to your desire. So, you know, you know, the Bhagavad
Gita is telling, you know, it is giving an elaborate analysis. So, all the
preceeding verses. They comprise an analysis. And this analysis is meant to
guide Arjuna towards the best action. So, you know, it, when Krishna gives us
some directions, it is not to deprive us of our freedom. But it is to sp..., to
save us, stop us depriving ourselves in the name of freedom. What we can get out
of life, we will get so much lesser if we, you know, you know, do not take
Krishna's guidance. Just like a child will get so much lesser out of a
thousa..., or thousand rupee note. So, to enable us to get the best bargain out
of life, Krishna wants us to, you know, choose. And choose intelligently. So,
but ultimately, it is, it is, you know, our free will. Krishna is never going to
take away the free will from us. So, at this point, more or less, Krishna has
sort of completed the instructions. Just like a teacher, you know, you know, who
is, you know, giving a class, you know, says, now, you can decide what you want
to do. So, now, that means, the owners has shifted from the teacher to the
students. So, like that, the student, the owner shifts on Arjuna. And the
acharyas describe that at this point, especially, Visv..., Visvanatha
Chakravarti Thakura says that Arjuna goes into deep thought. And he starts
thinking, what should I do? How should I act? You know. Krishna has told this in
the Second Chapter. And that in the Seventh Chapter. And that in the Eleventh
Chapter. And that in the Fifteenth Chapter. Now, he is contemplating very
seriously about what all should I do? What should I do? You know. You know. And
there is so much. There is, Arju..., so much that has been spoken. And
discussed. And analysed. So, Arjuna goes into grave thought. And seeing this,
Krishna's heart overflows with compassion. Krishna tells Arjuna, actually,
Arjuna, you do not have to think so deeply about things. You know. I see your
sincerity. I know. You do, you are not whimsical. You are not
independent-minded. You, actually, you want to do what is best for you. And you
have beaten me that you know that what I want for you is the best. So,
therefore, you know, I will guide you about what to do. I will guide you. So,
then, that guidance, Krishna provides in the next verse. So, here, the word
"aśeṣeṇa" means, Krishna is telling Arjuna, you can contemplate for as long as
you want. You know. As long as you want. You know. But there is an implication,
also, you know, how long will you contemplate? Actually, the living entity has
been trying to think about what will give me happiness for so many lifetime.
That lifetime after lifetime. But as always come to false conclusions. Ok. Maybe
this, or that, or that will give me happi..., but none, happiness. But none of
that gives happiness. So, therefore, "vimṛśyaitad aśeṣeṇa". So, contemplate. But
when Arjuna goes deep into contemplation. And is unable to decide, you know, so,
Krishna makes things even more clear.

        sarva-guhyatamaṁ bhūyaḥ
        śṛṇu me paramaṁ vacaḥ
        iṣṭo ’si me dṛḍham iti
        tato vakṣyāmi te hitam

So, it is a very beautiful verse. And this indicates why this section is the
conclusion of the Gita. "sarva-guhyatamaṁ bhūyaḥ". "sarva-guhyatamaṁ". This is
the most confidential knowledge. "sarva-guhyatamaṁ bhūyaḥ". So, "guhya",
prev..., previous verse was "guhya-taraṁ". Now, it is "guhyatamaṁ". It means
most. Good. Better. Best. So, this is the best. "sarva-guhyatamaṁ bhūyaḥ".
"bhūyaḥ" means again. "śṛṇu me paramaṁ vacaḥ". "śṛṇu". Oh, hear, Arjuna.
"paramaṁ vacaḥ". These are the supreme words. "iṣṭo ’si me dṛḍham iti". "iṣṭaḥ".
"iṣṭaḥ" means dear. You are very dear to me. You are strongly loved by me.
"dṛḍham". "dṛḍham" means determined. So, Krishna is determined to love us. "tato
vakṣyāmi te hitam". Therefore, "hitam". For your benefit, I am speaking these
things. So, you know, you know, this is, this verse indicates that Krishna, what
He is speaking, is a very intimate expression of His heart. You know. Krishna is not
like a teacher, who just give, who will detach, will give some instruction to
the students, which are, really does not, you know, you know, in educational
institutes where teaching is a paid profession. The teachers are not really very
deeply concerned about their students. There is some relationship between the
teacher and students. But nothing very serious. So, it is not like that. This
relationship between, you know, Krishna and Arjuna. Krishna is telling that,
"iṣṭo ’si me dṛḍham iti". You are very strongly loved by Me. In fact, I am
determined to love you. So, you know, actually, we are determined to forget
Krishna. In fact, ma..., in many ways, modern progress, you know, progress
actually means inventing newer and newer ways to forget Krishna. Of course, the,
the results of progress can also be used to serve Krishna. That is true. But
still, in many way, in many ways, what happens is, the more there is progress,
the more people tend to forget Krishna. Because they start thinking about, about
how to live separate from Krishna. And how to, you know, or not live, they may
not think about Krishna, also. But how they live separate from Krishna is that
they get involved. And en..., and lost in newer and newer forms of illusion. So,
for example, in the past, if people wanted entertainment, maybe, they would have
to go to some dance performance. Or some, they would sing. And generally, their
dances would be, say, in the Vedic culture, they would be Bharatanatyam. Where
Lord's pastimes would be depicted. Or otherwise, there would be, you know, there
would be, you know, some Hari Katha. Hari Kirtan. Hari, you know, so like that,
most of the entertainment was connected with Krishna. But then, now, we have got
television. And television, there are hundreds, over hundred channels. And
practically, there may be hundred channels. But, you know, knowledge about God,
you know, pure devotional knowledge about God is very rarely available anywhere.
And then, there is internet. And there are video games. And there are so many
newer and newer ways of forgetting Krishna. So, this is unfortunate. So, what
Krishna is telling over here, I am determined to love you. So, we ufortunately
have directed our intelligence away from Krishna. And because of which, we are
determined to forget Him. But, you know, by Krishna's mercy, we can turn towards
Him. We can learn to love Him. And we can, you know, reciprocate with His
determination to love us. So, Krishna is telling, "iṣṭo ’si me dṛḍham iti". So,
I am determined to love you. So, lifetime after lifetime, after lifetime,
Krishna never leaves us and goes away. He remains in our heart forever waiting.
You know. Forever waiting for us to turn towards Him. So, you know, as we have
discussed earlier, we, general, also, pris...:

        mādṛk prapanna-paśu-pāśa-vimokṣaṇāya
        muktāya bhūri-karuṇāya namo ’layāya

So, he says, "alayāya". My dear Lord, You are present in my heart. And You are
"bhūri-karuṇāya". You are immensely merciful. Greatly merciful. You know. Gopis,
in the famous Gopi Gita, saying "bhūri-dā janāḥ". You do great good to everyone.
You are the welfare worker for everyone. Or later, the "bhūri-dā janāḥ", they
are talking about devotees over there. But the word "bhūri" means good. Or
great, greatly good. So, "bhūri-karuṇāya". Your mercy is greatly good. It is,
you know, so, what is the "bhūr...", "bhūri-karuṇāya"? "alayāya". That you never
get tired. You are forever striving to do good to others. So, Krishna is, "iṣṭo
’si me dṛḍham iti". And how is Krishna expressing His determined affection?
"tato vakṣyāmi te hitam". "te hitam". Therefore, for your benefit, I am speaking
these words. So, Krishna is not speaking for His own benefit. You know. Just
like a sinc..., a good doctor, when speaks some instruction, that is for the
benefit of the patients. So, "tato vakṣyāmi te hitam". Some people think that,
oh, Krishna, you know, you know, Krishna needs us. Krishna wants us to serve
Him. No. Krishna does not need us. Actually, we need to serve Him. Because by
serving Him, we will become happy. And Krishna is also making
"sarva-guhyatamaṁ". Most confidential knowledge. "bhūyaḥ". Now, why is He using
the word "bhūyaḥ"? Because the knowledge about bhakti, which He is going to
give, He has given it earlier. So, earlier also, Krishna has used the word
"guhyatamaṁ" in, you know, you know, in, you know, firstly, in 9.1 and 9.2. 9.1,
He says:

        rāja-vidyā rāja-guhyaṁ

So, the, sorry, now, "idaṁ tu", so, 9.1 is, "rāja-vidyā rāja-guhyaṁ" is 9.2. And
9.1 is:

        idaṁ tu te guhya-tamaṁ
        pravakṣyāmy anasūyave

So, "guhya-tamaṁ". Most confidential knowledge. So, Ninth Chapter was going to
talk about, the title itself is "rāja-guhyaṁ" yoga. Most confidential knowledge.
But if we see, there is the knowledge of bhakt..., about bhakti. And "ananyāś
cintayanto māṁ" is 9.22. "patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ" is 9.26. And then, you
know, "man-manā bhava mad-bhakto" is 9.34. So, it is clearly, bhakti verses are
there. So, that is "guhyatamaṁ". And then, similarly, Krishna has also used the
similar, you know, you know, you know, re..., describer for describing in 15.20.
You know. In 15.20, Krishna says that, you know:

        iti guhya-tamaṁ śāstram
        idam uktaṁ mayānagha

"iti guhya-tamaṁ śāstram". In this way, the most confidential knowledge, I have
told you. That is why Krishna is using the word "bhūyaḥ". So, "guhyatamaṁ", He
has used in 9.1. As well as in 15.20. And, you know, but even when Krishna has
used that, He, Krishna is using double glorifiers over here. You know. "iti",
"te", "guhya", "it...":

        sarva-guhyatamaṁ bhūyaḥ
        śṛṇu me paramaṁ vacaḥ

So, "paramaṁ vacaḥ" are the supreme words. "paramaṁ vacaḥ". So, it is like,
first, most confidential knowledge. And supreme words. So, both are
superlatives. Which highlight how glorious is the knowledge that Krishna is
speaking. Supreme words. "paramaṁ vacaḥ". You know. Answer, Krishna has used
this word "paramaṁ vacaḥ", also, earlier. In this, in the start of the Tenth
Chapter. He says, 10.1:

        bhūya eva mahā-bāho
        śṛṇu me paramaṁ vacaḥ

"śṛṇu me paramaṁ vacaḥ". Oh, Arjuna. Hear My supreme words. And we see Tenth
Chapter, what does it contain? 10.8 to 11 is Chatur Shloki Bhagavad Gita. And
that is clearly bhakti. You know. "mac-cittā mad", "mac-cittā mad-gata-prāṇā".
And "dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ". 10.9 and 10. So, basically, this knowledge,
wherever Krishna has used these describers. "sarva-guhyatamaṁ". "guhya". So,
"guhyatamaṁ". Or "paramaṁ vacaḥ". Thereafter, He has described bhakti, only. But
nowhere in the Bhagavad Gita is such a combined and concentrated combination of
superlatives used. So, you know, combination means, we discuss, all the verses
were, "guhyatamaṁ" is used. "paramaṁ vacaḥ" is used. But this is one verse where
"guhyatamaṁ" and "paramaṁ vacaḥ" are both used in the same verse. And then, not
only that, further, there is, so, there is glorification of the knowledge. And
there is also empha..., expression about the intimacy of the relationship.
"iṣṭaḥ". "dṛḍham". "hitam". So, you know, you are very dear to Me. I am speaking
for your benefit. You know. So, this verse is very important to understand the
importance of what is going to come afterwards. You know. You know. To
understand the importance of what is going to come afterwards. So, this verse
indicates that Krishna is telling Arjuna that what I, this, what I am going to
speak to you now. The most confidential knowledge. The supreme instruction. And
I am going to speak to you because you are very dear to Me. And I want your
benefit. So, all this indicates that what is going to come again, come in the
future verses, is extremely special. Is extremely exalted. So, let us look at
what comes in the next verse. You know. You know. So:

        man-manā bhava mad-bhakto
        mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru
        mām evaiṣyasi satyaṁ te
        pratijāne priyo ’si me

"man-manā bhava mad-bhakto". You know. "man-manā bhava". That always think about
Me. "bhava mad-bhakto". Become My devotee. You know. "mad-yājī". Worship Me.
"māṁ namaskuru". Offer your obeisances unto Me. "mām". "mām evaiṣyasi satyaṁ
te". "satyaṁ te". You will certainly come to Me. "pratijāne priyo ’si me". You
know. This, I declare. Because you are very dear to Me. Now, this verse is very
important. You know. Again, because it is describing the supreme instruction.
But is also describing Arjuna, Krishna's affection. So, the first two lines of
this verse are similar to 9.4..., 34. 9.4..., 34:

        man-manā bhava mad-bhakto
        mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru

So, fix your mind on Me. That refers to the mind, of course. "mad". "man".
"man-manā bhava mad-bhakto". Offer your heart to Me. "mad-yājī". Worship Me. And
"māṁ namaskuru". That refers to our body. So, basically, these four are meant to
indicate that we offer our entire existence to Krishna. When we offer our entire
existence to Krishna. When we offer our entire existence to Krishna, then that
is what has been told in 9.34. And that is also recommended over here. But the
difference over here is that, there, it was, you know:

        mām evaiṣyasi yuktvaivam
        ātmānaṁ mat-parāyaṇaḥ

"mām evaiṣyasi". You will come back to Me. "yuktvaivam". By being, staying
engaged like this. "ātmānaṁ mat-parāyaṇaḥ". If your heart and soul are like this
engaged, then your "ātmā", if your "ātmā" is "mat-parāyaṇaḥ". Is "parāyaṇaḥ"
towards Me, is devoted to Me, then you will come back to Me. So, but Krishna
is telling over here something different. What is He telling? You know. You
know. He, there, if we look at the words, they are, the onus is on the devotee.
On Arjuna. So, you do like this, then "mām evaiṣyasi". You will come, "mām
evaiṣyasi" was there. You will come back to Me. But how? "yuktvaivam". By being
engaged in this way, and again, Krishna further clarifies, what does engagement
in this way mean? "ātmānaṁ mat-parāyaṇaḥ". By being completely devoted, you
know, whole and soul to Me. "ātmānaṁ". But here, Krishna's emphasis is
different. There, you know, you know, in any relationship, there are two
aspects. If there is relationship between two people, A and B. So, for the
relationship to be successful, what A is ready to offer to the relationship is
important. And what B is ready to offer to the relationship is also important.
So, in that 9.34, Krishna is emphasising what the devotee needs to offer in that
relationship. "ātmānaṁ mat-parāyaṇaḥ". But here, in 9, 18.65, Krishna is
telling what I bring in to that relationship. So, what does He bring in to the
relationship? Krishna is telling over here that, pra..., you know, "mām", "mām
evaiṣyasi satyaṁ te". "satyaṁ te". I am speaking the truth to you. What is? "mām
evaiṣyasi". You will certainly come back to Me. "mām evaiṣyasi". So, "satyaṁ".
Truth. So, 38:18
