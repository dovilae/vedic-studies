Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. Now, we
are about to begin the last chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. There are 700 verses
that are there in the Gita. Se..., the 78 verses are present in the last
chapter. So, the 18th Chapter is the longest chapter. Second longest is the
Second Chapter with 72 verses. And then, there are other chapters. Seven..., the
11th Chapter has 55 verses. Like that. So, this is by far the longest. And this
is also, as chapter that gives an overview of the whole Bhagavad Gita. And then,
it concludes in bhakti. So, this chapter is called as, you know, you know,
"Moksha Sanyasa Yoga". So, that kind of renunciation which will lead to
liberation. And Prabhupada translates it as "The Perfection of Renunciation".
So, let us look at the, you know, chapter overview before we move forward into
the contents of the chapter. You know. You know. You know. So, in this, you
know, first, you know, 12 verses talk about karma-yoga. Essentially, they talk
about how, how while doing karma-yoga, one can stay free from bondage. Then, you
know, this point is explained philosophically further in the second section.
There, it is described what keeps a, you know, what keeps a karma-yogi free from
bondage is the jnana of the karma-yogi. So, that is talked about in verses 13 to
17. Which describe the five factors of action. And they describe how whe..., you
know, when one understand these five factors of actions properly. And then, acts.
One will stay free from bondage. Then, in verses 18 to 40, the jnana for
karma-yogi, second parts are talked about. Second part is, what is the jnana?
That will, karma-yogi needs to have, this is about the modes of material nature.
So, the, in this case, this analysis of, further of, what are the elements of
action. And how those elements of action, you know, you know, like karma.
Kartha. Jnana. You know. You know. You know. Then, dhruti. And determination.
Knowledge. Doer. Action. And ultimately, happiness. How all these things, you
know, affect a person when that person is doing activities. And then,
accordingly, how, depending on which mode these are done in. There are a
prop..., appropriate result that comes about. Then, 41 to 48 talks about
karma-yoga offered to Krishna. So, after describing an overview of the previous
chapters. Which some deepen con..., the understanding, you know, karma-yoga,
now, this chapter moves onto an explanation of how karma-yoga can be offered to
Krishna. You know. You know. Then, after that, 49 to 55 talks about how
jnana-yoga, you know, with bhakti can be offered to Krishna. You know. How one
can perform jnana-yoga. And how it ultimately leads to bhakti. And then, the
last section, 56 to 78 talks about, you know, the glory of bhakti yoga. You
know. So, let us look at these chapters by the look, these verses. By starting
from the first verse.

        arjuna uvāca

        sannyāsasya mahā-bāho
        tattvam icchāmi veditum
        tyāgasya ca hṛṣīkeśa
        pṛthak keśi-niṣūdana

So, you know, you know, "sannyāsasya mahā-bāho". You know. Krishna is te..., you
know, is asking, being asked by Arjuna. You know. "tattvam icchāmi veditum". So,
I want to understand the truth of renunciation. "sannyāsasya", the truth of
renunciation. And then, gives another word. "tyāgasya ca hṛṣīkeśa". The, by the,
so, I have to, I want to understand "tyāgasya". Renunciation. And "pṛthak".
"pṛthak" means the difference. So, one understand renunciation. And I want to,
you know, understand, you know, "sa...", you know, "tatt...", "tyāgasya".
Pra..., now, Prabhupada translates this as the, you know, purpose of
renunciation and the renounced order of life. You know. You know. So, the
renounced order of life is sannyasa. And renunciation itself is "tyāgasya". So,
you know, "pṛthak keśi-niṣūdana". So, in this verse, three names of the Lord are
used over here. Which all indicate the, the Lord's capacity to destroy the demon
of doubt. So, He, the Lord is "mahā-bāho". He is very, He has very powerful
arms. You know. Then, He is "keśi-niṣūdana". He is the killer of "keśi". And
"hṛṣīkeśa". So, He is the, you know, Lord of the senses. He, and, you know,
senses are very formidable. And the senses need to be controlled. You know. You
know. You know. So, like that, you know, "pṛthak keśi-niṣūdana". Now, when we
talk about this, what exactly is the question? And how is it related with what
has been talked about earlier? You know. In this chapter. When we talk about
Krishna. And Arjuna's discussion. And the 17th Chapter ended with a mention that
Krishna is the, you know, Krishna recommends sacrifice according to scripture.
And if one is not doing sacrifice according to scripture, then gradually, by
having "oṁ tat sad". By chanting of the names of the Lord, one can, you know,
you know, scri..., spiritualise the sacrifices. So, there is no immediate, you
know, connection between Krishna's concluding verses, the 17th Chapter. And the
18th verse was, the 18th Chapter's first verse. Arjuna's question is generic.
Arjuna's question is generic in the sense that it is not related with,
specifically, to what has happened earlier. But Arjuna wants a conceptual
clarification of what should be His ultimate course of action. So, should, you
know, Arjuna has definitely got some understanding. Now, we, you know, by this
time, in fact, as we know, when he speaks at the end of Chatur Shloki Bhagavad
Gita in 10.12 and 13.

        paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma
        pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān

So, like that, when he glorifies the supreme position of the Supreme Lord. The
acharyas explained at that time, you know, you know, you know, Arjuna's illusion
is gone. You know. You know. Arjuna has understood the essential message of the
Gita. And he himself is expressing that message. But then, the subsequent
questions are, as the "Bhāgavatam" says "loka-hitaṁ nṛpa". For the, you know,
for the benefit of other people. Or the Bhagavad Gita uses word
"loka-saṅgraham". For the main..., maintenance of the world. How, how, by, you
know, said, by providing, you know, insights for, of how a person can live in a
proper way. You know. As per scriptural guidance. That is what is talked about
in the subsequent chapters based on the way Arjuna asks questions. So, Arjuna is
taking broad concepts. Broad terms. That are known in the Vedic context. But
that are not always, you know, you know, available. You know. In terms of a
holistic understanding. So, you know, you know, here, Krishna is giving Arjuna a
holistic understanding. You know. And in that connection is asking, what is
"tyāgasya"? And what is, you know, "sannyāsasya"? You know. So, now, after
describing this, that means Arjuna's essential question is, should I fight? Or
should I not fight? So, should I just renounce in spirit? Or should I renounce
in, in deed, also? So, that is the question. You know. Now, we will see how
Krishna responds to this. You know. You know. So, 18.2:

        śrī-bhagavān uvāca

        kāmyānāṁ karmaṇāṁ nyāsaṁ
        sannyāsaṁ kavayo viduḥ
        sarva-karma-phala-tyāgaṁ
        prāhus tyāgaṁ vicakṣaṇāḥ

So, you kno,w "kāmyānāṁ karmaṇāṁ nyāsaṁ". So, "kāmyānāṁ karmaṇāṁ" means for
"kāmyā karma". "nyāsaṁ" means gri..., renunciation. "sannyāsaṁ kavayo viduḥ".
So, the wise declare that what is "sannyāsaṁ"? "sannyāsaṁ" means to give up
"kāmyā karma". And "sarva-karma-phala-tyāgaṁ". And giving up all kinds of work.
That is "prāhus tyāgaṁ vicakṣaṇāḥ". "tyāgaṁ vicakṣaṇāḥ". That is actually
"tyāgaṁ". So, what doe..., what is Krishna talking about essentially in this
chapter? Let us try to understand this over here. You know. So, "tyāgaṁ" versus
"sannyāsaṁ". You know. So, there are two, you know, different times of "karma".
"karma" here refers to fruitive activity. Or rather, acti..., fruitive activity
which is according to scriptural direction. Not all scrip..., you know, fruitive
activity is, you know, is sinful. Especially, if there is, fruitive activity is
according to scriptural direction. That is good. So, in that, there is
nitya-karma. And there is kamya-karma. So, nitya-karma is standard prescribed
duty, is like sa..., sandhya-vandana. So, the brahmanas are supposed to do
"gāyatrī" every day. And that "sandhya-vandana" is a nitya-karma in the sense
that it has to be done every day. You know. And it is a, it is considered to be
a lifelong duty that a brahmana performs. On the other hand, there is
kamya-karma. Kamya-karma is that which is, you know, that kind of religious
activity. That karma which is done, you know, to fulfill a particular karma.
Like we have there dharma, artha, kama progression. So, dharma can also be
performed to per..., puff, get a particular kama. Of particular desire
fulfilled. So, here, "putra-kameshti yajna" is talked about. "putra-kama".
"putra", "eshti" is the desire. "putra-kameshti". That means when a king
performs a yajna, so that he will get a "putra". He will get a son. That is
for "putra-kameshti". "kameshti. So, now, what, you know, so, what Krishna is
telling over here is, you know, you know, If we go back to the verse now, here,
we will see:

        kāmyānāṁ karmaṇāṁ nyāsaṁ
        sannyāsaṁ kavayo viduḥ

So, among these two kinds of "karma". "kāmyā-karma". And "nitya-karma".
Sannyasis are meant to give up the, in a sannyasa ashram, one gives up the
"kāmyā-karma". So, for example, you know, you know, a sannyasi does not actually
continue with the actions of, you know, the householders. You know. The
householder may need certain, obviously, a sannyasi will not be doing a
"putra-kameshti". But there are other yajnas, also. Which 11:23
