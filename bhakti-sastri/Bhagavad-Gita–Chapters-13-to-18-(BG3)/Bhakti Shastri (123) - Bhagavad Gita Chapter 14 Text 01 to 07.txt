    prapanna parijataya
    totra vetraika panaye
    jnana mudraya krishnaya
    gitamrita duhe namah

You know. You know. You know. You know. Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our
Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We completed the 13th Chapter in our last
class. And now, we are looking at the 14th Chapter. You know. You know. To
understand the link between the 13th and the 14th Chapters. You know. Let us
have a quick review of the, you know, 13th Chapter's conclusion. You know. You
know. You know. 13th Chapter, the last section was gaining "jñāna-cakṣu". So,
there is 27, you know, you know, to 35. You know. So, 27 basically said
everything is a combination of matter and spirit. 28th stated that, by this, we
can see, when we see the spiritual, there is equal vision. So, when, what, so,
see everything material equally to attain s..., liberation. "tato yāti parāṁ
gatim". So, at material level, there is difference. But we see it equally.
Because we see beyond matter to the spirit. And then, see that spirit is the
non-doer. That was the 30th verse. See that all material variety originates in
spiritual similarity. That is, you know, the 31st verse. That is "yadā
bhūta-pṛthag-bhāvam". Then, see that the soul always remains transcendental. And
does not get entangled. And does not act. "na karoti na lipyate". And then, how
that is "na karoti na lipyate"? You know. That is talked about in the next two
verses. And then, lastly, it is, the told, the benefit is told that if one gets
this "jñāna-cakṣu", one will attain liberation. So, now, in this overview, the
important point is to recognise that, you know, you know, you know, this whole
the..., you know, analysis is implying a good level of understanding of the
modes. You know.

        anāditvān nirguṇatvāt

You know. That that the "guṇa"s do not affect a person. You know. Or the soul
remains transcendental to the "guṇa"s. And before that, also, it is, saw, it, it
was told that the, "gu...", it is the "guṇa" because of contact with the "guṇa"s
that the soul becomes bound. So, in 13.22, the bija vakhya, as it is often being
called:

        puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi
        bhuṅkte prakṛti-jān guṇān
        kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo ’sya
        sad-asad-yoni-janmasu

So, "kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo ’sya". Because of association with the three modes. What
happens because of it? "sad-asad-yoni-janmasu". That one meets with good and bad
in various species. So, you know, you know, "kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo ’sya". So, that
means "guṇa-saṅgaḥ" is the cause of bondage. And the soul is originally
"nirguṇatvāt". It is originally transcendental. And when the soul similarly goes
beyond the influence of the modes, one becomes free from bondage. So, basically,
the modes are considered to be the, you know, the, you know, critical factors
which bring about the bondage. We cannot say they are the cause of the bondage.
The cause, it is "bhuṅkte". The cause is the soul's desire to enjoy the material
world. But the way in which that bondage is executed, is through the modes. You
know. You know. So, recognising this enables one to develop some seriousness. In
knowing what are the modes. So, you know, you know, you know, the mode is a
mechanism by which the soul is bound within material existence. So, that will
be explained. That means these transcendental souls, entanglement in material
existence will be explained. So, this topic has not yet been explained anywhere
in the Gita. In detail. In the mechanism. Earlier, it has been talked about how
one should stay detached. While practicing spiritual life. While li..., living
in the material world, also. By doing one's professional du..., you know, you
know, professional duties. Varnashram duties. How one should remain, you know,
transenden..., you know, detached. And how one can transcend. That is talked
about. But here, how the bondage takes place. You know. Through the instrument
of the modes. That will be de..., you know, described in the 14th Chapter. So,
let us have an overview of the 14th Chapter. You know. You know. So, you know,
there are 27 verses in the 14th Chapter. So, the first 13 verses talk about how
the soul is conditioned by the modes. Then, verses 14 to 18 talk about the
effect of conditioning by the modes. And then, after that, 19 to 27 talk about
transcending the modes. You know. You know. So, you know, you know, first
section is how the soul is conditioned by the modes. So, like in several other
chapters. Like the Seventh and the Ninth chapters, the, you know, you know,
first section talks about glorification of the knowledge. You know. You know.
You know. Glorification of the knowledge means that this knowledge, how it is,
you know, valuable. Why it should be heard. What is the benefit. So, the, in the
Seventh and Nineth Chapters. Krishna had done something similarly. Ninth
Chapter, He says "rāja-vidyā rāja-guhyaṁ". Or Seventh Chapter, He says, you
know, you know, jna..., "idaṁ vakṣyāmy aśeṣataḥ". That, you know, this is, I am
giving you complete knowledge. After knowing which, nothing more is to be known.
Like that, there are glorificatory passages. Even in the Tenth Chapter, also,
Krishna has said that "jñānānāṁ jñānam uttamam". Sorry. No.

        bhūya eva mahā-bāho
        śṛṇu me paramaṁ vacaḥ

"paramaṁ vacaḥ". He had said. The supreme knowledge. You know. So, like that,
you know, you know, a, the glorification is done several cases. So, here, also,
something similar. Then, third and fourth verses talk about how the soul
contacts matter. Then, 5 to 9 talk about the, how the modes bind the soul. And
after that, you know, you know, 10 to 13 talk about identifying the modes
dominating us by their principal characteristics. By their principal
characteristics. Let us look at, you know, these one by one now. So, if 14.1:

        śrī-bhagavān uvāca

        paraṁ bhūyaḥ pravakṣyāmi
        jñānānāṁ jñānam uttamam
        yaj jñātvā munayaḥ sarve
        parāṁ siddhim ito gatāḥ

So, "paraṁ bhūyaḥ pravakṣyāmi". "paraṁ bhūyaḥ pravakṣyāmi". "bhūyaḥ" means
again. "pravakṣyāmi" is I am speaking. "paraṁ bhūyaḥ pravakṣyāmi". "paraṁ" is
that highest. Transcendental. The transcendental "jñānānāṁ jñānam uttamam". So,
that transcendental knowledge is the actually the best among all forms of
knowledge. "jñānānāṁ jñānam uttamam". So, again, I am speaking this. "yaj
jñātvā". And what happens? "yaj jñātv...". By knowing this, "munayaḥ sarve". The
great sages. "parāṁ siddhim ito gatāḥ". They have attained the supreme
destination. "parāṁ siddhim". What does it mean? "parāṁ siddhim ito gatāḥ". You
know. So, you know, this knowledge, basically, Krishna is telling that, the
glory of this knowledge is that, by understanding this, the great sages have
attained liberation. And, you know, He is using a significant word, "bhūyaḥ".
Why "bhūyaḥ"? Krishna has not talked about the three modes of material nature in
detail before. But the analysis of the three modes culminates in, you know, call
for devotional service. And that devotional service, Krishna has mentioned
earlier. So, in technical details, this knowledge has not been spoken before.
But in terms of the conclusive action plan, you know, you know, the knowledge
has already been spoken. So, in the Seventh Chapter. In Ninth Chapter
especially. Then, again, in the Tenth Chapter. The call for devotional service
has been consistent. And insistent. And, you know, you know, you know, also, you
know, of course, no doubt in the Twelfth Chapter. Which is about bhakti yoga
itself. And talks about multiple levels of bhakti. So, we will see that this
chapter will end with, you know, bhak..., you know, now, with, you know, you
know, two verses which establish the glory of bhakti. And the glory of Bhagavan.
And that has been what has, that is what has been done in the whole bhatki
section. So, that is why "bhūyaḥ". "bhūyaḥ" means again. What I have spoken
earlier, I am speaking again now. "yaj jñātvā". By knowing this, the great sages
have attained liberation. So, this knowledge is with, that which is used by
"munayaḥ"s. So, now, it is interesting, Krishna does not say that "yaj jñā...,
"jñātvā bhaktah sarve parāṁ siddhim ito gatāḥ". He says "munayaḥ sarve". Why?
Because, you know, the bhaktas do not necessarily need this kind of analytical,
you know, you know, understanding of the three modes. They will have some basic
philosophical understanding. But this verse is, this chapter is going to talk
about how the muni is, you know, take to devotional service. Why the munis
practice devotional service. Remember the 16th Chapter. Sorry. The, remember the
Twelfth, you know, 13th to 18th Chapters. The jnana section of the Gita talks
about how one can, you know, raise from the jnana level to the bhakti level. So,
one can raise from the jnana level to the bhakti level. You know. You know. You
know. By the practice of devotional service. In a, you know, so, now, you know,
so, by, by recognising the potency of devotional serivice intellectually. So,
this 14th Chapter will talk about the three modes of material nature. But after
talking about the three modes, it will eventually come to the conclusion that,
you know, you know, one should practice devotional service. You know. You know.
So, one should practice devotional service. And that is the essential conclusion
which comes, not because one has a spontaneous attraction to Krishna. But one
recognises that, you know, you know, devotional service is the best means to
gain liberation from the modes of material nature. You know. The, there is a
significant difference between the two. You know. The, just like we have the
levels fear. Desire. Duty. And love. At which people can approach God.
Similarly, there can be multiple levels at which people approach the Supreme
Being.

That means they may approach the Absolute Truth at the level, you know, you
know, fear. Desire. Duty. And knowledge. So, like that, you know, similarly,
people may approach, you know, the specific process of devotional service not
out of love. They may app..., you know, you know, approach it because of
knowledge. So, you know, that means, at the level of duty, they understand. At
the level of duty, we understand. This is what I am expected to do. This is what
I am supposed to do. So, at the level of knowledge, one understands, I am
trapped in material existence. I have to get out material existence. And the
way to get out is, is by practicing devotional service. And that is how one
approaches the process of bhakti. So, that is also, you know, fine. In the sense
that, you know:

        yena tena prakāreṇa manaḥ kṛṣṇe niveśayet

So, that is why in this chapter, the focus will be on else of the modes. How the
bondage because of the modes is so complex. And it is so difficult to break free
from. And then, you know, one recognises that by taking shelter of Krishna, one
can break free from this. So, therefore, "munayaḥ". The, it is the munis. Those
who are, you know, who used to agitating their minds. To try to come towards
certain conclusions. Those munis will attain the shelter of Krishna. By taking
the, you know, by taking to the process of devotional, you know, will not attain
to the shelter of Krishna. Sorry. Will take the shelter of Krishna to, you know,
attain transcendence from the modes. "munayaḥ sarve". So, Prabhupada writes in
the purport, you know, you know, that, you know:

"The knowledge explained in this chapter is proclaimed by the Supreme Lord to be
superior to the knowledge given so far in other chapters."

Now, this is interesting. Now, it is interesting because Krishna has said, this
is "bhūyaḥ". And then, this is also "jñānānāṁ jñānam uttamam". So, how do we
understand this? Krishna says, among all the knowledge that I have spoken, this
is better than all other forms of knowledge. You know. You know. You know.
Superior to other forms of knowledge. Or other knowledge, other kinds of
knowledge that I have given. And yet, Krishna is saying I am speaking this again
to you. So, if Krishna has spoken this earlier, then it is not superior to what
has been given earlier. But, you know, if it is superior, you know, i...,
i..., if it is su..., if it is superior to what He has given earlier, you know,
you know, you know, then, you know, how can He be giving it again? So, the point
is that Kri..., in, you know, previously, Krishna has given various kinds of
knowledge. He has talked about karma yoga. He has talked about dhyana yoga. He
has talked about, you know, jnana yoga. He has talked about various subject
matters. And among those subject, many subject matters, one subject matter which
He has also talked about is bhakti. Of course, He has talked about bhakti
repeatedly in the bhakti section. You know. So, de..., so, definitely, the
talking has been much more. But the point is He has talked about it earlier. But
among the various subjects that He has talked about, bhakti is the highest. And
He has spoken it earlier. So, He is repeating it. But He is also telling that
this is better than all the other forms of knowledge that I have given. So, in
that is way, we can re..., you know, we can reconcile both these understandings.
And "parāṁ siddhim". By this, one can attain the supreme destination. The
supreme destination for the jnani is, is brahman. For the bhaktas, it is the
spiritual world. So, depending on one's understanding of the Absolute Truth, one
can attain either of destinations. You know. Now, Krishna goes, goes on and
glorify this knowledge further.

        idaṁ jñānam upāśritya
        mama sādharmyam āgatāḥ
        sarge ’pi nopajāyante
        pralaye na vyathanti ca

So, "idaṁ jñānam upāśritya". If one takes shelter of Krishna, "upāśritya". You
know. Sorry. Not of Krishna, you know, of this knowledge. It is interesting. We
will see, talk about this difference. "mama sādharmyam āgatāḥ". One will attain
"sādharmyam". One will attain the same destination. "mama sādharmyam āgatāḥ".
And "sarge ’pi nopajāyante". "sarge". At the beginning, one will not, because of
this, "sarge ’pi nopajāyante". You know. You know. You know. You know. One will
not be able to attain, you know, again, one will not attain. Or one will not
know have to undergo. "sarge" at the time of creation. "upajāyante". One will
not have to take birth again. And "pralaye". At the time of destruction, one
will not, not have to "na vyathanti ca". One will not, not have to undergo
destruction again. "pralaye na vyathanti ca". So, "idaṁ jñānam upāśritya". You
know. You know. You know. You know. And, now, here, Krishna is talking about
"idaṁ jñānam upāśritya". So, He is not saying that take shelter of Me. He is
saying, by taking shelter of this knowledge, you will attain a nature like Mine.
What is the meaning of this? You know. That, actually, this, you know, it, you
know, the, the message of Krishna, you know, is also something which we can take
shelter of. You know. You know. You know. The philosophy is also to be taken
shelter of. The philosophy is not to be approached, you know, you know, merely
for the sake of, you know, you know, analysis from a controlling perspective.
You know. Normally, when we study a subject, you know, if it is, for example,
now, if we have to solve a crossword puzzle. You know. Then, yeah, I cracked it.
Or when we have to give an exam. And then, there is some difficult question. I
s..., cracked it. I did it. So, the whole idea is that there is a difficult
problem to solve. And then, I solve it. And then, I get that "īśvara-bhāva".
That sense of victory. That sense of controllership in the arena of spirit. In
the arena of, sorry, not in the spirit. In the arena of spirit. In the arena of
ideas. Yes. I did. May, it means, it is, it is actually intellectual, you know,
sovereignty. Intellectual supremacy. Intellectual conquest. Not just of any
ordinary subject. We are seeking intellectual conquest now when we study
scripture of Krishna. And Krishna cannot be conquered by intellect. That is a
wrong approach. And Krishna has, saw, told earlier, also, "nāhaṁ vedair". That I
cannot be known merely by the study of the Vedas. So, actually, "jñānam
upāśritya". When we take the, you know, when we, are, study the knowledge, also.
You know. You know. You know. At that time, you know, you know, one, you know,
studies it so that one can release and relief from the, you know, confusion of
material existence. From the inevitable doubts. Perplexities. And dilemmas that
we are presented with in material existence. And to find, ok, what is the way I
should act ahead. So, we approach this knowledge to take shelter of the
knowledge. You know. You know. Or there is some people wear a crown on the
head. Now, a crown, you know, if I am going out in the rains. A crown does not
serve very well as an umbrella. You know. A crown may just, just slightly
protect my head. But the crown is primarily meant for ornamental purposes. If I
want protection from the rains, what I need is umbrella. I do not need a crown
at that time. So, if we treat, you know, the spiritual knowledge like a crown on
our head, then it will not act as an umbrella. And we will not get relief from
the elements by that knowledge. That, elderly, from the elements is, they are,
say, you know, a crown cannot really offer much protection from, you know, you
know, the stormy rains. Or the scorching heat of the sun. You know. You know.
Fro..., you know, it cannot offer, you know, that kind of protection. But
umbrella can.

So, similarly, if we try to, you know, take the spiritual knowledge. And try to
make it an ornament for our own egos. I know so much. I know so much. You know.
And accordingly, we try to practice. Then, at that time, we do not really get
much benefit. Because we are missing the whole point. The point is, you know,
you know, you know, you know, that we want to learn. We want to move forward.
And we want to attain the supreme destination. What is that supreme destination?
We want to attain love for Krishna. And love is not a matter of conquering. Love
of, matt.., matter, you know, love of matter of giving. You know. You know. We
give ourselves to another person. You know. In love. And then, when we give
ourselves, that person reciprocates. And then, when two people give themselves
to each other, that is the deepest love. You know. So, like that, you know, the
whole idea of, you know, you know, love, there is conquest. No doubt. But then,
that is not a, you know, we do not go out to conquer. You know. You know. When
we love, we actually say, say, fall in love. We do not say conquer in love. You
know. We fall in love. What does it mean? You know. You know. That means we let
ourselves be conquered by love. So, similarly, with respect to jnana, we, with
respect, when we are trying to develop a relationship with Krishna. Our goal is
not to conquer Krishna with jnana. Our goal is to, you know, you know, you know,
you know, be conquered by Krishna's love. And to be conquered by Krishna's love,
we want to, you know, you know, you know, offer ourselves to Him entirely. And
we offer ourselves to Him, you know, in various ways. One way is through the
intellect. So, the intellect is also meant to be used as a means to surrender to
Krishna. To attain His shelter. So, "idaṁ jñānam upāśritya". You know. So, as
devotees, when we, we take shelter of Krishna's message. We take shel...,
shelter of the knowledge that He has given us. That is, you know, now, all this,
I am talking from the bhakta perspective. From the jnana perspective, also, one
tries to do, imm..., one, immerse ver..., self, oneself in knowledge. And, you
know, vimar..., "vimarsanam". "vimarsanam". The word "vimarsanam" sounds like
the English word immersion. Immersion means just put oneself completely within.
So, like that, "vimarsanam". We absorb ourselves in knowledge. When we absorb
ourselves in knowledge, to "vimarsanam". Jnana "vimarsanam". Then, by that, we
are able to go beyond to a large extent of material natures. And it is by, it
i..., and its complications. So:

        idaṁ jñānam upāśritya
        mama sādharmyam āgatāḥ

I will attain, Krishna says, "mama sādharmyam". What is the "sādharmyam"? You
know. Nature. So, dharma, as we know, has many meanings. Here is an example
where the word dharma means nature. So, yeah, you know, just like we say,
Prabhupada has talked about in the, you know, Bhagavad Gita that, in his
Bhagavad Gita introduction that "mama sādharmyam āgatāḥ". He has talked about
how, you know, My, you know, you know, you know, you know, how our dharma is
eternal. He has talked about sanatan dharma. Our goal is to love and serve. And
that is our dharma. Not our goal. That is our her..., nature itself. So, our
purpose. Our perfection. Our nature is to love and serve. And then, when we
direct that loving and serving nature towards Krishna, then our, we, you know,
we, our dharma becomes our sanatan dharma. We act according to our eternal
nature. And that brings us eternal happiness. So, ma..., so, that sense of the
word dharma. When Krishna uses the word sense, you know, He uses the word dharma
in many different ways. So, He has used the word "sarva-dharmā...", He has,
then, so, for example:

        dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya
        sambhavāmi yuge yuge

So, when He uses that word in 4.8, you know, you know, at that time, you know,
you know, He is using it in terms of the social order. You know. The
sociocultural, the social, cul..., you know, social spiritual, the sociocultural
spiritual order. That is conducive for one's devotional advancement. So, He uses
the word dharma in that sense of a, the dharmic order in society.
"dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya". And even Krishna uses the word dharma in 14, in
18.66:

        sarva-dharmān parityajya
        mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja

At that time, He uses it, you know, in the sense of talking about, you know,
"sarva-dharmān parityajya". That give up the lower dharmas. So that one can take
shelter of the highest dharma. The highest dharma is bhakti. So, in order to
take shelter of the highest dharma, one should give up the lower dharma. And
that will happen by the practice of bhakti. So, that is what has been talked
about over here. "mama sādharmyam āgatāḥ". So, there are, you know, there are,
you know, different levels of, you know, so, there are different usages of the
word dharma. And, you know, you know, when Krishna has said that, you know, you
know, here, He uses the word "mama sādharmyam". That one will attain My dharma.
That refers to, they will attain My nature. "mama sādharmyam āgatāḥ". And then,
"sarge ’pi nopajāyante". "sarge". At the beginning, there will be, at the time
of creation, there will be no "upajāyante". "upajāyante" means there will be no
destruction. You know. You know. You know. There will be no, you know, taking
birth again. And "pralaye na vyathanti ca". And when one, you know, die..., one
does destruction, there will be no bewilderment. That means, basically, one will
go beyond bodily consciousness. When one goes beyond bodily consciousness,
for..., one does not have to take birth again in this material existence. Not
only that, you know, when we are not in bodily consciousness so much, we will
not have to suffer so much at the time of death, also. Because we will go beyond
the body to a large extent. You know. You know, You know. So, now, in a, here,
Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that, you know, you know, you know, you
know, you know, you know, you know, Prabhupada explains, what, so, it means. You
know. This.

"One who thus develops the spiritual qualities is not affected either by the
creation or by the destruction of the material world."

You know. So, because we attain the spiritual nature. We develop the spiritual
qualities. You know. So, therefore, one does not have to go through the cycle of
birth and death. One tran..., one's consciousness goes so high that one can
transcend it. You know. You know. Now, the next section is going now. What is
the next section? Or next subsection, we could say. How the soul contacts
matter. You know.

        mama yonir mahad brahma
        tasmin garbhaṁ dadhāmy aham
        sambhavaḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
        tato bhavati bhārata

So, "mama yonir mahad brahma". Now, here, Krishna is using the word brahma, you
know, to refer to material nature. We have discussed earlier how the same word
can have different meanings in the Gita. So, here, the word brahman refers to
material nature. You know. So, "mama yonir mahad brahma". So, this is, you know,
you know, this brahma is the, you know, you know, you know, "yoniḥ". The womb in
which I give the "garbhaṁ". "tasmin garbhaṁ dadhāmy aham". "aham". I. "dadhāmi".
I give the seed. From which, the womb is formed. The pregnancy takes place. The,
you know, impregnation happens. And then, "sambhavaḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ". Then,
"sambhavaḥ" is to manifest. To become possible. All living beings. "tato bhavati
bhārata". So, here, what is Krishna telling, essentially, what is the
connection? Krishna has glorified the knowledge in the previous chap...,
previous two verses. Yes. Caught Arjuna's attention. Oh. This knowledge. So
important. That by which, one can become cy..., free from the cycle of birth and
death. So, let me hear it. Just caught, you know, the reader's attention. You
know. Through this description. Now, He is telling, He start going, beginning
the knowledge. And saying that, you know, actually, right from the beginning of
creation, right from the beginning of material existence, He plays a vital role.
So, "mama yonir mahad brahma". So, actually, "mahad brahma". That great brahma.
"tasmin garbhaṁ dadhāmy aham". You know. You know. "garbhaṁ dadhāmy". One, you
know, in that brahma, one give...., one impregnates oneself. So, Krishna
impregnates, you know, a Himsel..., how do we understand by Himself? Actually,
ultimately, even material nature is His own energy. And the souls are His
energy, also. So, in that sense, "Ekoham bahusyam". The one becomes many. "to
akamyatah", you know, "tato". So, that Absolute Truth desired. That Absolute,
27:40
