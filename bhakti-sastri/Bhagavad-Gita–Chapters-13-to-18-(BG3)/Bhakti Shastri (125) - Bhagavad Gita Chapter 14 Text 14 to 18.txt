    prapanna parijataya
    totra vetraika panaye
    jnana mudraya krishnaya
    gitamrita duhe namah

Hare Krishna. Welcome back to the Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are
now in the Fourth Chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. You know. We discussed in the
previous section about how the mo..., modes are, are, can be understood from
their cha..., diff..., you know, characteristics which manifest when they, you
know, when one mode, subor..., you know, su..., when one mode predominates over
other modes. So, now, after this, Krishna will describe, you know, the, we have
discussed until 13. Now, we are discussing, now, verses 14 to 18. Effect of
conditioning by the modes. You know. So, 14, you know, 15 talks about the
long-term effect. In terms of what happens after death. The post death
destination. Then, 16th verse, He talks about the medium-term effect. In 17th
verse talks about the immediate effect. Then, 18th verse talks about the overall
direction of the post-mortem journey. You know. You know. You know. Let us look
at this discussion now.

        yadā sattve pravṛddhe tu
        pralayaṁ yāti deha-bhṛt
        tadottama-vidāṁ lokān
        amalān pratipadyate

So, "yadā sattve pravṛddhe tu". At the time. "yadā". At which time? Whenever.
"sattve pravṛddhe tu". "sattve" is "pravṛddhe", is the earlier, the word, there
was used, was "vivṛddhaṁ". Here, "pravṛddhe". Both mean the same thing. When
"sattve" is stronger. At that time, "pralayaṁ yāti deha-bhṛt". "pralayaṁ" means,
you know, death. "pralayaṁ" can mean destruction. It can refer to the final
destruction. At, of the universe that happens. You know. Final universal
destruction that happens at the, you know, you know, end of the lifetime of
Brahma. So, the word "pralayaṁ" can refer to death. The word "pralayaṁ" can also
refer to various other things. So, in the Bhagavad Gita, the word "pralayaṁ" is
used to refer to death. You know. It is, you know, used to refer again in the
16th Chapter, also.

        cintām aparimeyāṁ ca
        pralayāntām upāśritāḥ

So, you know, in 16.11 and 12, Krishna talks the..., about those peop..., the
ungodly, demoniac people, who make sense gratification as the only goal of their
lives. For those people, you know, you know, you know, you know, "pralayāntām
upāśritāḥ". Until the moment of death, there will be "cintām". There will be
anxiety. So, there, also, the word is used. "pralaya" for death. So, here, also.
"pralayaṁ yāti deha-bhṛt". So, those who are "deha-bhṛt". The embodied souls. If
they die when the mode of goodness is prominent. Then, what happens?
        
        tadottama-vidāṁ lokān
        amalān pratipadyate

So, "pratipadyate", they will attain. What will they attain? You know. The
"amalān" planets. The spotless planets of the "uttama-vidām". "uttama-vidām" is
those who are the knowers. You know. "vidā". "vidām" is to, "vidām" is to know.
"uttama" is, you know, that which is above "tama". So, that which is a higher,
you know, state of knowledge. So, those, you know, auspicious planets, those
pure planets, with, where the, you know, where the knows, the knowers of, you
know, the kno..., the knowers live. "uttama-vidām". The knows, knowers of the
higher knowledge live. They, that, that those "lokā"s will be attained. So,
earlier, Krishna has described that, "prakāśaḥ". He has used the word "prakāśaḥ"
to characterise the mode of goodness, you know, twice. First, in His initial
description in 16.6. And again, in another description, in 16.11. So, those who
live in knowledge in this life, they gain further knowledge after this life.
That is how it is. We live in knowledge. We will gain further knowledge by that.
So, "uttama-vidām lokān". "uttama-vidām lokān". "amalān pratipadyate". So, this
can refer to the svarga. It can, actually, it refers to even higher "lokā"s,
also. Above the svarga "lokā"s. This does not refer to liberation clearly.
Because Krishna will talk about liberation later on. After desc... describing
the analysis of the three modes. You know. You know. You know. You know. You
know. But if we live in goodness, then we attain the destination, you know, as a
destination, those places which are in goodness. Now, our, our svarga "lokā" is
in goodness? You know. Relatively speaking, we could say yes. As compared to the
earthly planetary system. Where often people live without any, you know,
reference to scripture. The, you know, the svarga "lok...", the, these people in
svarga "lokā" are definitely, you know, more in goodness. They definitely accept
the authority of Vishnu. They accept the authority of the Vedas. You know. But
even if they do not, not necessarily accept the, you know, accept the, you know,
you know, pro..., pro..., pure, process of, to pure devotional service. The
process of devotional service. And the goal of pure love. They will not acc...,
you know, you know, they may not be aspiring for that immediately. They are
devotees. They may not be pure devotees. But they are definitely devotionally
minded. And they are more, you know, theistic. They saw, saw, you know, the
acceptance of scripture authority. The acceptance of devotion to Vishnu. That
itself is indicative of their goodness. So, that devatas are definitely in
goodness as compared to the earthly planetary system. But other devatas are in
goodness as compared to transcendence? No. You know. Devatas are not so much in
goodness as compared to transcendence. You know. Sorry. Not even in then,
com..., as compared to the, you know, life, say, Brahmaloka. Or Patsata,
Satya "lokā". Janaloka. Tapa "lokā". The upper planetary systems. Where
people perform austerities. And where, you know, in, there are no, in, say, Tapa
"lokā". Janaloka. It is not that people are drinking Soma Rasa. And, you
know, you know, enjoying with apsaras. In, so, there the, you know, you know,
life is much more focused on austerity. Much more focused on liberation.  Much
more focused on transcendence. So, that will be much more goodness. So, we
should not think of goodness as just one homogeneus, you know, attitude.

You know. Even within goodness, also, there are levels. So, there are, there are
goodness which is much more towards passion. Then, there is goodness which is
much more closer to transcendence. And then, there is intermediate goodness,
also. So, if we consider goodness not as a homogeneity. But as a sp..., spectrum
within a, within an overall, you know, you know, you know, within an overall
shade of, you know, purity. As it is "amalān". "prakāśaḥ". It is lang..., of
knowledge and purity. You know. Within that, you know, with that, you know,
common setting, there is the spectrum over there. So, it is, so, "uttama-vidām".
So, if people live in goodness, then they attain these "uttama-vidām lokān". So,
even those in svarga are not necessarily always considered "uttama-vidām". You
know. You know. Because, you know, they are also caught in the pursuit of sense
gratification. You know. So, so, living in goodness can take one to svarga. It
can take one higher to than svarga, also. It depends on the level of goodness
that one has cultivated. You know. Now, after describing this, "amalān
pratipadyate". You know. Then, after that describes that what happens when one
lives in the modes of passion and ignorance. That is talked about in the next
verse. You know. You know. You know. You know.

        rajasi pralayaṁ gatvā
        karma-saṅgiṣu jāyate
        tathā pralīnas tamasi
        mūḍha-yoniṣu jāyate

"rajasi pralayaṁ gatvā". "rajasi". When there is a mode of passion. "pralayaṁ
gatvā". If one dies in the mode of passion, you know, then, what happens?
"karma-saṅgiṣu jāyate". "karma-saṅgiṣu". That those who are attached to fruitive
work. That means those who are materialistic. If one dies in the mode of
passion. Then, one is reborn here. You know. In, you know, you know,
"karma-saṅgiṣu". In attachment to fruitive action. "tathā pralīnas tamasi". And
if one dies in the mode of ignorance, then "mūḍha-yoniṣu jāyate".
"mūḍha-yoniṣu". So, "karma-saṅgiṣu" refers to the earthly planetary system
primarily. Here, people are attached to doing fruitive work. And "mūḍha-yoniṣu".
So, "mūḍha-yoniṣu", you know, you know, we see a parallel structure over here.
"jāyate", "jāyate" is there in, you know, B and D. And "yoniṣu", "saṅgiṣu" is,
you know, similar sounding. And "karma" and "mūḍha" are almost words that have
the same levels of sus..., same number of syllables. So, we see, there are many
places where the Gi..., Gita. Charac..., the Gita, characteristic of Bhagavad
Gita, the poetry characteristics do come out. You know. So, the "karma-saṅgiṣu
jāyate". And "mūḍha-yoniṣu jāyate". So, "mūḍha-yoniṣu" refers to, "mūḍha" is, as
we know, it can refer to a foul. Or it can refer to a, you know, donkey. So, a
donkey, you know, "mūḍha-yoniṣu". You know. So, those who live in animal like
species. Those who are, those who are, animal, animal, the, basically, the word
species. Those who are foul, the foulish species. That is the animals. That
means if one lives in ignorance, then one attains the lower species. So, here,
what Krishna is essentially telling is that, you know, you know, you know, you
know, if we live in passion, then we come back. You know. Take birth here again.
So, sometimes, you know, people ask this question that, you know, today, you
know, it is said that, you know, if the number of souls is fixed, then why is
the population increa..., how do we understand the increase of population? You
know. So, actually, that is not very difficult to understand. Because, you know,
firstly, the increase in population is a very relative conception. You know. We
really do not have clear population, or estimates of, or fo..., thousands of
years ago. You know. Several thousands, years ago. You know. The, the whole idea
of discovery of, you know, new lands. Which was a medieval concept. When they
say, America was discovered. Or Euro..., or India was discovered. You know. So,
this whole concept of discovery of new lands, that is based on the idea that
those lands, you know, were unknown to the, you know, European one. You know.
And that is why they were said to be, you know, you know, discovered. But there,
people were always living. And very few esti..., tribal estimates can be had
about, say, how many native Americans were staying in, you know, America. Before
the, you know, white schema, or for, what was the population of India before,
say, Alexander came, or before so, even 3000, 4000 years ago, it is very
difficult to tail. So, first of all, you know, we can, the whole idea of
population measuring is, you know, very difficult, you know, to go beyond, you
know, to reliably g..., you know, talk ab..., to talk about in a reliable sense
for, you know, several thousand years ago. You know.

So, even if somebody does not accept the Vedic, you know, understanding that
there is one world rule, you know, in the Vedic culture all over the world. At
that ti..., you know, even if one does not accept that. Still, the point remains
that our ten..., conception of history is very i..., limited. So, to say that
the world population has increased far more than ever before. That is a, you
know, substantial, you know, you know, leap of faith. And inference that is
based on leap of faith. Which is not necessary for everyone, you know, to take.
You know. There can be intelligence scepticism about it. Now, you know, you
know, regarding the increase in population in recent times, you know, we
understand, you know, the whole concept of reincrease in population is because
of the idea that population is, you know, limited to the earth. You know. Earth.
Life is limited to the earth. And population is limited to the earth. But no.
You know. If we have, if we decide to de..., make the, to measure the population
of Mumbai by looking at the crowds at a, you know, you know, at the, say, the
CST railway station. At a railway, railway station. Then, what will happen is,
you know, at, if we take the, you know, you know, be..., if we observe the CST
station, say, between 8 to 11 in the morning. Rush hours. Traffic hours. And
people are going to work. Or maybe 5 to 10. 5 to 8. 9. Something. If I, thing.
And the evening. Then, again, we will say, oh, there is a population explosion
over here. And maybe, even we go at, you know, 1 o'clock. 2 o'clock. 3 o'clock.
You know. If I know the clo..., there is a, more, it seems there is a population
decrease over there. But what is happening, what we are talking was population
increase. Or population decreases. Very relative, you know, to, you know, it is
limited to a particular area. And it is limited to a f..., particular time. But
if we look from the broader perspective, all that has happened is, the
population that was here, the population that was at various place, f..., other
particular time, it comes here. And then, it moves away from here. So, you know,
you know, you know, we understand that life exists, that the souls exist in
different species. And the souls exist in various planets. And because they
exist in different species and in various planets, therefore the souls do have,
you know, you know, the souls do have the, you know, you know, the, you know,
capacity to live at various places. And in ta..., you know, in certain
conditions. For certain durations. The number of souls at one particular place
may be more. And the number of souls at other places may be less. So, this can
pe..., easily happen. And it is, intoxi..., signify, it is, it is not contrary
to the Vedic understanding of how population dynamics works. So, now, today,
people are living prominently in the mode of passion. And passion combined with
ignorance. So, you know, people who are living the human forms, you know, you
know, because they are not getting elevated, they may continue, they do not go
to the high, they are not living so much in goodness. So, they do not go to
higher, they have, high, or higher. And they live in passion, they may continue
to live over here. Now, of course, if they live in passion combined with
ignorance. Or they live largely in ignorance, then they will definitely go down.
You know. You know. So, passion is also a spectrum. You know. When the ksatriyas
live, the righteous ksatriyas, are they in passion? Yes, they are in passion.
But they are in the upper exi..., if we consider special, passion to be a
spectrum that they are in the upper side of passion. And, you know, you know,
and people who, in the name of passion, or, or to fulfill their passion and
desires, start acting in, you know, you know, violation of scripture. And act
sinfully. Then, they are moving towards ignorance. And that is extremely
undesirable. So, that will be, you know, on the lower side of the spectrum. And
that will go towards ignorance, also. So, if people live in passion with some
level of dharma, that may enable them to take birth again in the hu..., human
form.

So, and there will be some animal species who are coming up to the human form.
So, you know, it is very difficult for us with our limited perspective, the
universe, to know why the population is increasing at a particular place. Or
why it is decreasing at a particular place. And whether it is actually
increasing or decreasing also can be a matter of debate. You know. You know. If
we really take substantially long time durations. So, either way, the important
point is to recognise that, li..., you know, life is there everywhere. And there
are principles according to which, we get our future destinations. So, you know,
if we live in ignorance, we go down to the lower species. And if we live in
passion, then we are, take, we take bath again. So, then, Prabhupada talks
about, here, reverse transmigration. Reverse transmigration means, so:

"Some people have the impression that when the soul reaches the platform of
human life it never goes down again."

You know. You know. You know. You know. The, so, what has happened is, how does
this may, conception come about? You know. You know. You know. There are people
who, you know, try to, by their own intellect, integrate different religious
systems. So, in Christianity, also, in the Bible, also, there are references to
reincarnation. Even the Bible, as it is now. You know. There is a whole history
of why, you know, there are no explicit references to reincarnation, right now.
You know. You know. You know. You know. You know. I talked about in my book. In
"Reincarnation". And basically, they were, you know, you know, there was a
European emperor. You know. When initially, during the Roman empire, European
empire, Roman empire, you know, so, you know, you know, the Christianity was
prosecuted. And then, around the Fourth Century, you know, you know, with the
Roman Empire, which had earlier been prosecuting Christians, you know, when the
Roman Empire came to a political collapse due to the mo..., moral collapse among
its people. Then, in order to re..., gain political stability. And in order to,
you know, have some moral, you know, you know, structure for that purpose, the
Roman Empiror, you know, choo..., adopted Christianity as its official religion.
You know. And when that happened, you know, they adopted Christan principles.
But his purpose was not so much spiritual, it was political purpose. Which are
pro..., adjusting and in, others who were involved in this, you know, in
acceptance of Christianity as the mainstream religion, so, at that time, and
from that time onwards, the doctrines were, you know, you know, you know,
adjust..., were changed. So, that, you know, people could, you know, you know,
be more submi..., more, more submissive and obedient to the king. So, the idea
was that if people are told, there are many lifetimes, then they will not, you
know, you know, follow, you know, you know, the rules of God, which in turn
meant the rules of the king, strictly. You know. You know. You know. So, give
them life. One lifetime. Or give them hell. That was, what was the slogan that
came about over time. And that is how eventually, you know, you know, you know,
eventually, things collapsed. You know. And, you know, Christian..., the, in
references to incarnation, whatever there, they were purged out. Now, like any
scholar rel..., issue, based on, you know, pratyaksa. Anuman. This is, there is,
these are a, multiple versions of what actually happened. But the important
point is that even with the, you know, you know, Bible as it is, you know, it,
or incarnation is not intrinsically incompatible with the Bible. With the
biblical world view. And there is references which do support it. But you know,
what, what we are discussing right now is that, you know, you know, you know,
you know, you know, the, you know, you know, or, or, Chri..., mainstream
Christian..., you know, Christianity, as it exists today, does not accept
reincarnation. So, when the, you know, you know, Christians came to India. When
the Britishers came to India. And established their rule. And along with them,
Christian missionaries also came. And then, many other thinkers also came. So,
they, so when, some western thinkers. And some Indian thinkers. They tried to
integrate whatever they saw good Christianity. And whatever they saw good in the
tradition Indian religion. And based on this integration, you know, they tried
to, you know, you know, you know, come up with, they tried to come up with, you
know, their own ideas of thought. So, one of the ideas which they brought
together is the concept of reincarnation is very good. You know. You know. That
is, you know, God is kind. Because God gives us many chances.

He does not, you know, you know, you know, He does not, you know, decide based
on only one chance. Yes. If you know, if cannot do it in this lifetime, the next
lifetime also is there. So, it, it, you know, actually harmonises with the idea
of a merciful God. Otherwise, if God just gives us one chance. And if we do not
accept that chance, then he sends us to hell forever. That is a, you know, you
know, difficult concept to digest for most people. It does not, people, He does,
a very harsh. And judgemental God. Not at all a merciful God. So, they try to
integrate this idea of Christia..., of, of mul..., multiple lifetimes. But they
felt that the idea of hu..., animals, you know, having souls was repulsive to
their sensibilities. Why was it so repulsive? Because, you know, they felt that,
you know, you see dogs. You see hogs. You see, you know, they do not have any
sense at all. How can a soul go that way? How can a soul, who was a, how can a
soul, how can human being become like that? Their consciousness is so different.
Their thinking is so different. Their whole mentality is different. They cannot
have that. So, prior to that, also, although, you know, you know, in the Bible.
In the old testament, there are references to the soul's present even in, you
know, birds and animals. And especially, in animals, that is why it is said that
one should eat fruits and, you know, roots, but not, you know, one, there are
le..., references which say that, you know, animals also have souls. And that is
why fruits and, you know, herbs and recommnended as food. But still, in spite of
that, the result was, you know, that people continued to have their own, you
know, you know, ideas of how to integrate. So, the, so, prior to this, in
Christianity, there was a Christian thinker, "Thomas Aquinas". You know. Very,
you know, respected sch..., scholar in biblical history. Second probably, only
to, Saint, you know, Saint Augustine. You know. But, anyway, whatever he, he
was. So, he came up with the idea that there are three kinds of souls. He said,
there are, there are human souls. There are animal souls. And there are plant
souls. So, He said, human souls are rationale. Animals souls are sentient. And,
you know, you know, plant souls are, basically, called them as vegetable souls.
So, he said that, these differe..., there are these differences in the souls
itself. You know. So, it is not that there is one kind of soul in all living
beings. The souls themselves are different. And his idea was that only human
souls are eternal. All the other souls, they are created. And they are destoyed.
You know. You know. They do not exist forever. You know. And, you know, you
know, you know, you know, now, of course, some of them will not have the idea
that, that, now, it is, the souls are created. So, the Christians, thinkers have
redefined eternal. Eternal means existing forever. But they say, ok, existing
forever from the point of creation. Not before this. So, actually, there is, you
know, in, you know, when we talk about, you know, you know, you know,
reincarnation. We have to understand two different concepts. There is
preexistence. And then, there is after-life. So, if on an X axis, we consider,
say, there is this patch from L to from, say, from B to D. So, B is birth. And D
is death. So, that patch is our current life. So, if in this patch from B to D,
The area before this will be our, you know, will be pre-existence. And then,
what comes after D is after-life. So, after death is after-life. What comes
before birth is pre-existence.

So, now, Chri..., the materialistic world view is that, there is only this life.
And there is nothing else. That is all. Now, the Christian understanding is
that, ok, there is this life. And for those who accept the redeeming grace of
Jesus, then for them, there is li..., after-life, also. For others, you know,
there is hell. So, that means, from now onwards, the soul is eternal. And some
souls can attain eternal destination in their, in their conception of the
kingdom of God. Others will go to hell. You know. So, they accept after-life.
But not pre-existence. So, now, that is why they say that when the man and woman
come together, a new soul is created at that time. The souls are created. But
they are not destroyed. Something like that. Their idea is. So, anyway, the
point is that the concept of pre..., you know, after-life is there in Chri...,
you know, in Chris..., so many Christian doctrine, you know, Christian, you
know, a field nominations. You know. You know. When, you know, for only this,
you know, for only human souls. So, it, there are human souls. The, so, they
can beat, they can, they have after-line. And they can attain eternal life in
the kingdom of God. 25:17
