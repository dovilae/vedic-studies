Hare Krishna. Welcome back to the Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. Now, we
are in the last part of the 13th Chapter. 13th Chapter is entitled, the "Nature,
the Enjoyer and Consciousness". So, we discussed how the chapter overview is.
Let us have a quick look at that. Based on that, we will understand, you know,
what is happening in the chapter. So, Arjuna has asked questions about six
things. "kṣetraṁ". "kṣetra-jñam". "puruṣaṁ". "prakṛtiṁ". And "jñānaṁ". And
"jñeyaṁ". So, Krishna has answered about all these six until now. You know. The
last section discussed about "puruṣaṁ". And "prakṛtiṁ". And now, Krishna will
give us an integrated world view. A "Jnana-chakshu". In which, He will explain
how all of this fits together. So, that is the verses from 27 to 35. So, let us
look at these verses. So, this is not really, directly related with any specific
question that Arjuna has asked to Krishna. But this is a bonus which Krishna is
giving as a further integrated view of what, you know, of the concepts that
Krishna has taught, you know, talked until now. Especially in this chapter. You
know. You know. You know. So, 13.27.

        yāvat sañjāyate kiñcit
        sattvaṁ sthāvara-jaṅgamam
        kṣetra-kṣetrajña-saṁyogāt
        tad viddhi bharatarṣabha

You know. You know. "tad viddhi" is commonly used by Krishna. Know this. So,
what i..., what is this that "bharatarṣabha"? The best of the Bhāratas should
know. "yāvat sañjāyate". Whatever exists. "sañjāyate". So, comes into being. Or
exists. Comes into existence. "sañjāyate kiñcit". Even the smallest of it.
"sattvaṁ sthāvara-jaṅgamam". That that maybe "sattvaṁ". That, in the existence
which may be moving or non-moving. "kṣetra-kṣetrajña-saṁyogāt". It all comes by
the contact of the "kṣetra". And the "kṣetrajña". The contact of the, you know,
knower of the field. And the field itself. So, what is Krishna doing in this
chapter? You know. In this particular verse. Essentially, He is telling that,
or, you know, the, you know, variety of this world can be reduced down to
fundamentals. And that capacity to reduce the diversity to fun..., you know, to
fundamentals, you know, that helps us to develop a more enlightened view. So,
ultimately, you know, whatever we see in this world, if I see a beautiful
painting, it is a combination of "kṣetra" and "kṣetrajña". That there is colors.
There is paints. There is canvas. And all, that, all that is a part of the
"kṣetra". And then, there is a painter. That is, that is the "kṣetrajña". And
the combination of "kṣetra" and "kṣetrajña" has produced, you know, the, you
know, paintings. So, like that, if there is a big building. Building is also a
combination of "kṣetra" and "kṣetrajña". So, this is a "k...", philosophical
vision. In general, "Jnana-chakshu" is that which enables us to see things more
deeply. More seriously. More, you know, lovingly. You know. How lovingly?
Ultimately, when we see Krishna, then we see things lovingly. But before that,
we see them more dispassionately. We, with respect to material things, we want
to become detached. And with respect to spiritual things, we want to become
attached. But when we look at this world, we do not want to be infatuated with
this world. You know. And that is why we talk about detachment in terms of, you
know, seeing with "Jnana-chakshu". So, when we see, oh, the, so many things are
captivating. But ultimately, it is nothing, but "kṣetra". And "kṣetrajña". That
combination. Then, we do not get so worked up by these things. You know. You
know. So, we un..., now, beyond the sco..., the "kṣetra". and "kṣetrajña", there
is, of course, ultimately the supreme "kṣetrajña". And that will come a little
later. The supreme "kṣetrajña" is the "īśvaraḥ". Who is the controller of
everything. So, Krishna in, now, first, He describes in 27th, ok, see all of
creation as just made up of, all of existence are made up of ma..., made up of
"kṣetra" and "kṣetrajña". Now, what should, once we understand this, what is the
result of that? That brings equa..., equal vision. You know. So, that is talked
about in this verse. And in the next verse, the result of that equal vision is
talked about. So, let us look at this verse now.

        samaṁ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
        tiṣṭhantaṁ parameśvaram
        vinaśyatsv avinaśyantaṁ
        yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati

You know. So, "samaṁ sarveṣu bhūteṣu". "samaṁ" is equally. "sarveṣu bhūteṣu".
One who sees all living beings equally. "tiṣṭhantaṁ parameśvaram". One sees the
"parameśvaram", you know, the, you know, the "īśvaram" who is "parama". So, the
acharyas have explained what is being referred to here in different ways. So,
here, Prabhupada explains that this can refer to, "parameśvaram" can refer to
the Supreme Lord. And it can also refer to the Jiva. Now, "parameśvaram"
is referring to the Jiv..., you know, Supreme Lord, is easily understandable. He
is the supreme "īśvaram". Often, the word "parameśvaram" is used that way. How
can it refer to the Jiva? The "īśvaram" who is, you know, "parama". The word
"parama" does not necessarily have to mean supreme. The word "parama" can also
mean transcendental. You know. You know. So, you know, just like "para" and
"apara" "prakṛtiṁ", "para" does not necessarily mean, have to mean supreme. It
simply means transcendental. So, "parameśvaram". "parameśvaram" means that
"īśvaram" who is transcendental. Who is not actually material. Although, may be
currently in material consciousness. So, "samaṁ sarveṣu bhūteṣu". When we see
all living beings. And then, what do we see them? "tiṣṭhantaṁ parameśvaram".
One sees that the s..., transcendental Lord is situated in the, in the hearts of
all living beings. And one sees, they themselves are actually transcendental.
And what is the specific relevance of this? With respect to the context of
Arjuna? And Krishna being on the battlefield? "vinaśyatsv avinaśyantaṁ."
"vinaśyatsv". "vinaśyatsv" is, it is destructible. What is destructible? The
body is destructible. Arjuna was concerned that what will happen to my, you
know, you know, you know, elders? Especially "Droṇa" and Bhishma? How can I
possibly kill them? He is saying actually you should be able to see that they
are not the bodies. They are the souls. "vinaśyatsv avinaśyantaṁ". You know.
That although the body, they are in perishable bodies, they themselves are
imperishable. And "yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati". One who sees like this is the true
seer. Krishna has used this, you know, phrase "yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati". This
line. You know. You know. Several times. In the Bhagavad Gita. As well as it
comes in the Mahabharata. In the Bhagavad Gita, this has come in the Fifth
Chapter. You know. You know. You know.

        yat sāṅkhyaiḥ prāpyate sthānaṁ
        tad yogair api gamyate
        ekaṁ sāṅkhyaṁ ca yogaṁ ca
        yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati
        
In 5.5, describes how, one, you know, you know, should see, one see the true,
you know, the commonality in the paths of yoga and sankhya, as both being meant
for the same ultimate purpose of attaining the, of knowing in, attaining the
Absolute Truth. So, the, one who sees like this. One who sees beyond
superficial differences to the common goals. You know. Then, then, such a person
is actually the seer. "yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati". So, similarly, here, that means
when Krishna says "yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati", the idea is what? That this is how
we should try to see. You know. We all want to be enlightened. We all want to
have proper understanding. And proper knowledge. We have that knowledge. Then,
rsi..., this is how we should see. "yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati". You know. So,
"samaṁ sarveṣu bhūteṣu". So, actually, one of the great results o..., of
acquiring knowledge is the capacity to go beyond, you know, superficial biases,
prejudices. And, you know, you know, emotional, emotionally induced
misconceptions. You know. You know. So, if we start seeing that all people are,
you know, I am an Indian. So, you know, people make blanket statements. You
know. I am an Indian. That person is Pakistani. All Pakistani is a terrorists.
Or some people say that, oh, these people are muslims. Muslims are terrorists.
Or, terrorism, so, there are so many people which equate certain people with
certain characteristics. You know. For example, some people may say that,
saudarius, they are all foolish people. Now, and people make jokes like that.
Now, if this is all of characteristic of bodily misconception. You know. Every
soul. Whichever be the community. Whichever be the race. Whichever be the
gender in which the person has born. Ultimately, that person is a soul. And, you
know, the, of course, there are differences at the bodily level. And we do not
deny those differences. There may be certain cultural and sociological
differences, you know, you know, which come because of the body. And
accordingly, we will have to deal accordingly, we go, you know, appropriate
ways. But we also have to see the commonality. So, this sort of superficial
differences, which can divide nations. Sometimes, you know, if s..., there are
dynastic flood, feuds, you know, long ago, in some, you know, there are two
opposing family. Then, one family, maybe somebody has killed that other family
person. Somebody person, somebody has probably. And then, the sons, they become
enemies. And then, the grandsons become enemies. And the great-grandsons become
enemies. And it is, continue to be fighting generation after generation. 10:12
