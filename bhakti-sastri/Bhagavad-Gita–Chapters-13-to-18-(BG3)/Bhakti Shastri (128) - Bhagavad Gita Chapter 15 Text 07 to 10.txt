Hare Krishna. Welcome back to the Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are
now in the 15th Chapter. Starting with verse 7. Let us look at the chapter
overview. Before we move forward. So, the first section we completed, attain
liberation by detachment. So, that was based on the, you know, you know, you
know, understanding of the upside-down banyan tree metaphor. And then, if one
does not attain liberation in this way. Then, one will have to, you know, un...,
you know, stay in bondage. And undergo transmigration. So, that is the section
from 7 to 11. You know. Sta..., so, the 7, so, 15.6 ended by saying that, yes,
this is the spiritual world. And the spiritual world is, you know, Krishna's
abode. It is self-luminous. And it is beyond, you know, it is once attained, one
does not come back from there. So, three characteristics were described in,
about the spiritual world. So, that, those three characteristics are glorifying
the spiritual world. After that glorification is done, now, it is told that, ok,
if the spiritual world, if that is the abode. That is where we belong. Then, why
is the soul, you know, here? So, that will be discussed in this verse. And the
soul's, you know, journey in the material world will also be discussed in
subsequent verses. You know.

        mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke
        jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ
        manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi
        prakṛti-sthāni karṣati

So, "mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke". That "mama", "aṁśaḥ". Krishna is telling that all
living beings, "jīva", you know, "jīva-loke". They are in the world of
conditional life. They are My "aṁśaḥ"s. And "jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ". You know.
They are eternally my parts and parcels. And:

        manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi
        prakṛti-sthāni karṣati

That they are undergoing "karṣati". "karṣati" is struggling. And suffering. They
are struggling and suffering in, you know, this material existence. Bec...,
where? Because of what? "manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi". That the six senses which
include the mind. You know. That is the cause of their suffering.
"manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi". So, you know, you know, now, this verse has two parts.
And both of them are important. And then, the combination of those two parts is
also important. So, A and B are telling a very important philosophical truth.

        mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke
        jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ

So, this is telling that, you know, the living entity is eternally a part of
Krishna. So, we are "aṁśaḥ". And we are "sanātanaḥ", "aṁśaḥ". So, this is
important. Because, you know, the impersonalists have the idea that we will
eventually become one with God. And we will merge in his existence. But here,
the verse very clearly says that we are "aṁśaḥ". We are parts. And how do one?
The part will, never becomes the whole. And the part is such a part that will it
merge? No. "sanātanaḥ". Earlier, also, it has been said that the soul is, you
know, you know, you know, can, soul cannot be cut by anything. So:

        acchedyo ’yam adāhyo ’yam
        akledyo ’śoṣya eva ca

So, whatever material transformations happen because of the various elements of
nature. You know. Wind. Water. All those. They do not affect, you know, the
soul. You know. You know. So, so, that, if the soul is not cuttable, then that
means, if the soul is a part. It has always been a part. And it will always be a
part. Soul is not cuttable. The soul is not changeable. Then, if it is "aṁśaḥ".
Then, it will always be an "aṁśaḥ". So, that can be inferred even from the
earlier verses. But it is made even more emphatic. And unambiguous. By the word
"sanātanaḥ". So, we are "aṁśaḥ"s. And we are "sanātanaḥ". Eternally, the
"aṁśaḥ"s. And whose "aṁśaḥ"s? "mamaivāṁśo". That is also important. "mama".
"aṁśaḥ". It is not just a brahma "aṁśaḥ". You know. You know. You know. We are
not just, you know, we are not just sparks of spirit. We are a parts of the
spiritual person's, supreme spiritual person. So, sparks of spirit. You know.
So, the example sometimes is definitely given of how the Supreme Lord is like a
flame. And we are like sparks. So, that is gi..., you know, example that
illustrates the qualitative oneness of all living beings. But it does not
necessarily illustrate, you know, you know, anything more than that. It simply
makes the point that this is how the living entity, you know, how, this is how
we all exist. You know. In relationship with Krishna. In terms of qualitative
oneness. But the, the fire itself does not have any personal, you know,
personality directly. At least the way we perceive it. And, you know, you know,
the, fla..., similarly, the flame, also. The spark also does not have
personality. But when we talk about the supreme absolute reality, the absolute
reality is a person. Krishna has also said "ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo". "mattaḥ
parataraṁ nānyat". 10.8. 7.7. He has said there is no reality higher than Him.
So, "mama" is important over here. Krishna is saying that they are all My
"aṁśaḥ"s. Not just brahma "aṁśaḥ"s. Or brahma, you know, you know, you know, you
know, pa..., some, you know, some, you know, temporary, you know, emanations
from Brahman. Or something like that. No. They are My parts. And they are
eternally My parts. You know. The, and then, they are "jīva-loke". So, that word
"jīva-loke" is the connection with the, you know, next part. So, you know, the
first part ex..., expresses the philosophical truth. That, you know, you know,
this is the, you know, this world is a place o..., you know, that we are parts
of Krishna, eternally. It is, it is very strong refutation of mayavada. Now,
second part also contains a very important truth. You know. What is that?

        manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi
        prakṛti-sthāni karṣati

So, you know, "karṣati". "karṣati" is struggling and suffering. So, that is
itself an important truth. But that has been mentioned by Krishna earlier in the
Bhagavad Gita. "duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam", He has talked about in 8.15. And then,
again, in 9.33. He has said.

        anityam asukhaṁ lokam
        imaṁ prāpya bhajasva mām

So, the, and then:

        janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-
        duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam

He has also talked about in 13.11. So, that has been mentioned that "karṣati".
"prakṛti-sthāni karṣati". That this material world is a place of misery. So, and
the living entity is suffering over here. So, of course, the slightly more
emphasis. The earlier verses were talking about how material world is miserable.
And this verse is talking about how we are miserable over here. How the living
entity is miserable. So, you know, you know, you know, you know, but the
important point over here, the addition is:

        manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi
        prakṛti-sthāni karṣati

So, the "karṣati". The struggle and suffering is happening because of the mind
and the senses. "manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi". So, you know, you know, so, normally,
the "indri...", "indriyāṇi"s are considered to be five. But in the Bhagavad
Gita, you know, you know, the, you know, "indriyāṇi"s are often groupped with
the mind. Even when Krishna was talking about sankhya. In 13.6. So, the, there,
also, He said "indriyāṇi daśaikaṁ ca". So, "daśaikaṁ". "daśaikaṁ" is eleven. So,
there, Krishna included in that eleven, the Karmendriyas. 5 Karmendriyas. 5
Jnanendriyas. And the mind. So, you know, you know, in general, in the Bhagavad
Gita's analysis, the mind is groupped as one of the senses. Even in the "Vibhuti
Yoga". 10th Chapter. You know. You know. You know. Krishna has said "indriyāṇāṁ
manaś cāsmi". That I am the mind among the senses. So, the mind is consider...,
is groupped along with the other senses. Generally, in the, you know, in the
methology of the Bhagavad Gita. In the nomenclature. And the taxonomy. The way
Bhagavad Gita classifies things. So, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
know, now, you know, "manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi". What is the significance of
stating that, you know, you know, the living entity is suffering because of the
senses? Or in, is, is suffering. And it has senses. You know. The six senses
which includes the mind. The significance is that, actually, most people think
that the, you know, senses are the sources of happiness. You know. You know. You
know. People have the idea that, oh, by my eyes I will see beautiful things. By
the tongue, I will eat delicious things. And like that, through all the senses,
I will enjoy. And people think of the senses as the sources of happiness. But
Krishna is telling, by associating in, in this phrase. "karṣati".
"manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi". So, the mind and the senses. The soul is a part of
Krishna. And it is well-known that that the soul being a part of Krishna,
has the nature of Krishna. So, Krishna is sat-cid-ananda. Similarly, we are also
sat-cid-ananda. So, then, why are we suffering? Because of
"manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi". So, material world, itself, is a place of suffering.
And that suffering is aggravated. And multiplied. You know. You know. Worsened.
By, you know, the entanglement with the mind and the senses. So, there will be
old age. Disease. And death. You know. Which is largely inevitable. You know.
But, you know, when the mind and senses are uncontrolled. And that leads to
great attachment to worldly things. And due to the attachment to wordly things,
one ends up suffering far more, you know, you know, than what one needs to. For
example, if a person becomes alcoholic. Then, all the su..., the suffering that
comes upon oneself, one's health. One's career. One's, you know, family. The
society at large. All that suffering is because of, you know, you know, the,
this is, self-indu..., this is self-induced. It is, you know, you know, it is a
self-sentence. You know. Generally, a court sentence if somebody to, suffering
when the person has done wrong. But when we make wrong choices. We, there is a
self-sentence. We sentence ourselves to suffering. So, why do we, why would
anyone sentence oneself to suffering like that? That is the effect of, insidious
effect of the mind and the senses. "manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi".

So, the mind and the senses, they alienate us from Krishna. You know. You know.
They alienate us from Krishna. Alie..., alienate means take us away. To make
aliens. So, when alien, the word of, alien is, you know, generally used to talk
about, say, life, you know, for..., lifeforms of some other planets. Maybe, they
come here. They are aliens on this. So, do, are they aliens on our earth? The
word alien is used in that sense. So, people have fascination. That oh, maybe,
there are aliens. Will they do, they come on the earth? And do they explore the
earth? Do they do research over here? So, the Bhagavad Gita turns that whole,
you know, you know, telescope around. Telescope that is searching for aliens.
And it points to us. Points to the real me. That is the soul. And it tells us
that, actually, it is we who are the aliens. You know. Instead of searching
whether there are some aliens on earth. We have to recognise that we ourselves
are aliens. And not just on earth. We are aliens within all of material
existence. We are actually souls who belong to the spiritual world. You know.
You know. So, the, we do not belong to the material world. "prakṛti-sthāni". You
know. To be situated in material nature. Which is perishable. And miserable. Is,
you know, you know, not the consti..., not the nature of the soul. It is
unnatural situation. So, "prakṛti-sthāni" is 15.7, is similar to:

        puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi
        bhuṅkte prakṛti-jān guṇān
        kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo ’sya
        sad-asad-yoni-janmasu

So, in 13.22, Krishna says "prakṛti-stho hi". The soul is situated in material
nature. So, we are ourselves the aliens in this material world. And being
aliens, being in a foreign territory which is perishable. And miserable. We
suffer, also, because of that. So, the way to break free from the suffering is
by returning to our original nature. That is the spiritual nature. So, the
second part that is worth, conveys is the senses are the cause of our "karṣati".
They are the cause of our sufferings. So, Srila Prabhupada highlihts both these
points in this purport. You know. You know. You know. So, Prabhupada explains
that, you know:

"The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual
identities of the Godhead, are always present. Similarly, the separated
expansions of living entities have their identities."

So, when Prabhupada talks about "aṁśaḥ", he makes the point that even the, you
know, even the Supreme Absolute Truth is not a homogenous, you know, oneness.
That there is diversity even in the Supreme Absolute Truth. That there are many
forms of the Supreme Lord. As Prabhupada mentions. "Rāma". "Nṛsiṁha-deva".
"Viṣṇumūrti". So, all these are different incarnations. Which are there. And
they are also the "aṁśaḥ"s. Now, of course, they are "sva-aṁśaḥ"s. There is
"vibina-aṁśaḥ". And there is "sva-aṁśaḥ". So, "sva-aṁśaḥ" is, "sva-aṁśaḥ" is
the, you know, you know, one's own expansion. That is the Vishnu-tattva. And
"vibina-vibinna" is a separated expansions. Those are the, you know, jivas. So,
the jivas do not have the same potency as the "vibina-aṁśaḥ"s. You know. But,
you know, they are also parts of the Lord. So, both, so, Prabhupada emphasises
the point that both are eternal.

        mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke
        jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ

Just as the various incarnations are, have their eternal abodes in the spiritual
world where they reside eternally. Similarly, in this world, also, similarly,
the souls are eternal. So, both "aṁśaḥ"s are "sanātanaḥ". Then, Prabhupada
explains that, you know, you know, all living entities are parts in Krishna. You
know. When:

"The word karṣati"

You know:

"karṣati (“struggling” or “grappling hard”) is very significant."

What is significance? Prabhupada says that:

"The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by iron chains."

We may say I do not see any iron chains. Yes. Be..., these are the chains which
are subtler than iron. They are made of "asapas". They are the desire. Our own
desires. Which are shackling us. So:

"He is bound up by the false ego,"

So, actually, what binds the soul to matter is the false ego.

"and the mind is the chief agent which is driving him in this material existence."

And then, Prabhupada explai..., correlates this with the modes.

"When the mind is in the mode of goodness, his activities are good; when the
mind is in the mode of passion, his activities are troublesome; and when the
mind is in the mode of ignorance, he travels in the lower species of life."

You know. "in the lower species of life". So, to understand this point about how
the false ego i..., i..., binds. And the mind is the agent that drives, let us
return back to the example of watching a movie. Or a virtual reality show. So,
you know, you know, you know, suppose I am the spectator. And, you know, or I am
the person who is participating in the virtual reality show. And then, in front
of me is the monitor. On which the virtual reality show is going on. So, now, I
can look here. I can look there. And I can come out of the spell that the movie
may be causing on me. But it is nearly impossible for me to come out of that
spell. Because my eyes are riveted to that. How are they riveted? Now, suppose,
I am watching a, you know, computer screen. Or a TV monitor. Or, or TV screen.
So, now, if, you know, if we visualise that, suppose there is, you know, you
know, you know, a tunnel-like structure. You know. It starts a pipe, a pipe-like
structure. It starts from my head. And moves right up to the movie screen. So,
that, I cannot look anywhere else. You know. My vision is locked onto that
screen. So, that, you know, that, you know, you know, you know, you know,
pipe-like structure. The tunnel-like structure which locks my vision to the TV
screen, that is the false ego. I am the soul. The false ego is what? It rivets
to bodily reality. And then, the, you know, screen, screen is the computer. So,
you know, sorry, the, the scr..., the computer screen is the mind. The, so, this
is I am, what I am speaking, this is based on, you know, the analogy of
Puranjana. The allegory of Puranjana rather. Analogy is an example in which come,
correlations are made. Allegory is w..., a more elaborate story. In which, you
know, you know, the, you know, same, with the, some philosophical points are
illustrated. But not just, you know, in an abstract concept. But it is the, that
concept is illustrated through some characters. And those dynamics between those
characters. So, there is analogy of Puranjana in the Fourth Chapt..., Fourth
Canto of "Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam". And I will not go into the full analogy over
there. But "Drutakarmā" Prabhu, one of Srila Prabhupada's, you know, scientist
disciples. Has he written a, you know, you know, has published a paper on this.
"The City of Nine Gates". Which is published also in "Back to Godhead". So,
there, he, to explain this Puran..., Puranjana analogy, he uses this virtual
reality concept. And he explains that, you know, you know, this, you know, mind
is like a multimedia computer. That integrates inputs from all the various
senses. And, and puts them for display for the, you know, soul to behold. And
respond to. So, that we will, that will be talked about in the next verse. About
how the mind integrates. You know. But at this point, the point is that:

        manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi
        prakṛti-sthāni karṣati

So, if we were watching a, you know, you know, movie screen. But there was no
movie being played over there. Then, we will soon get bored by it. And then,
even if our head is shackled to that. We will try to find out, what is the way
to become free? But if the very captivating movie is playing over there, then we
become more and more riveted. More and more focused on that. And then, we cannot
see any. Even if we try to look here. Look there. You know. We are just caught
over there. We cannot see anywhere else. And that is how we get, become
captivated. So, the false ego, it, what, bi..., it binds and the mind it drives.
How does the mind drive? Because on that, you know, video screen, might, various
images come up. And when different images come up, then we get captivated. Oh,
this looks good. This ta..., this tastes good. This, this feel very soft to
touch. Let me do this. Let me enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. So, mind drives. So, drives
how? By providing images. By providing, you know, obje..., by presenting on its
screen. Objects for enjoyment. The objects that captivate. Now, you know, we,
even when we have a TV, it can have many channels. So, it is some channels can,
may be educational. Some channels may be, you know, you know, filled with
sexuality. And passion. And some channe..., or fa..., channels will be perverse.
You know. Brutal. Violence. And bloody murder. And, you know, you know, you
know, you know, grew some forms of, you know, violence. Sexuality. And abuse.
And things like that. So, you know, is like goodness. Passion. Ignorance. So,
Prabhupada is saying that, when a, you know, when the soul is in goodness, the
activities are, as Prabhupada ens..., mentions over here.

"When the mind is in the mode of goodness, his activities are good;"

You know. Well, they are reasonable good. They are, they are still in material
existence. But they are good. When the mind is in the mode of passion. That
means what is being displayed on the screen of the mind is, you know, filled
with, you know, you know, you know, sexuality. And passion. Then, the activities
are troublesome. Then, we exp..., we increase our, you know, complications. Our
bondage.

"and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he travels in the lower species
of life."

"lower species of life". So, one goes downwards. You know. One does terrible,

        jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthā
        adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ

As was said in 14.18, "jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthā". "jaghanya" is abominable. You
know. So, that is how that person goes down. Now, you know, you know, when this
is happening like this. The mind is going up or down. Or, so, the one is, you
know, the mind is in different modes. Basically, it means that what is being
displayed in the mind is, you know, different at different times. And depending
on, now, all these three ultimately cause struggles. Because even when we say
the mind's activities are good in goodness. Still, in goodness, also, one has to
grow, go, undergo old age. Disease. And death. One cannot avoid that. So, that
is inevitably there. But basically, there is this difference that, you know, you
know, there may be degrees of suffering depending on the mode in which one is
situated. And Prabhupada, you know, quotes from the, you know, "Mādhyandinā...",
youy know, "Mādhyandināyana-śruti". "sa", "eṣa". You know.

"sa vā eṣa brahma-niṣṭha idaṁ śarīraṁ martyam atisṛjya brahmābhisampadya brahmaṇā
paśyati brahmaṇā śṛṇoti brahmaṇaivedaṁ sarvam anubhavati"

So, you know, "sa vā eṣa brahma-niṣṭha idaṁ". Brahman, when one, one becomes
situated in the Brah..., you know, spiritual platform. "brahma-niṣṭha idaṁ
śarīraṁ martyam atisṛjya". You know. You know. So, one gives up, you know, the,
you know, one gives up the material body. "śarīraṁ mart...", at the time of
death, then "brahmābhisampadya brahmaṇā paśyati". So, one sees the Brahman.
One, "brahmaṇā śṛṇoti", one hears the Brahman. And "brahmaṇaivedaṁ sarvam
anubhavati". One actually experiences Brahman. So, you know, so, the point here
is, that, it is very clea..., it is mentioning over here that there are senses.
And, you know, you know, one perceives with the senses. So, "śṛṇoti". "paśyati".
One sees with the eyes. One hears with the senses. So, this is actually talking
about two things. Two significant things. First is that, even when the soul
becomes liberated, the soul has perceptions. And not just perceptions. But it is
talking about sensory perceptions. "śṛṇoti". And "paśyati". So, wi..., with
eyes. And with ears. And along with that, the second point is that there is
something to perceive. If the Brahman, if the Brahman were just a
non-differentiated oneness as the impersonalists conceive. Then, there will be
nothing to perceive, actually. Everything will simply be one. What is there to
perceive at such a time? But then, the, there is definitely a lot to perceive.
And what is there to perceive? That depends on, you know, you know, the
recognition that there is a personal reality. You know. That the highest reality
is person. There is the, Brahman is the Supreme Absolute Truth as a person. And
the living entity is even after liberation, they are also persons. So, they are
persons endowed with senses. And the Lord is a person endowed with form. And the
living entity endowed with senses. "brahmaṇā paśyati". With eyes. Senses. So,
this "brahmaṇā paśyati" is referring to the living entities taking darshan of
the Supreme Lord. "brahmaṇā śṛṇoti" refers to the living entities relishing the
sweet, you know, speech of Krishna:

        madhurayā girā valgu-vākyayā
        budha-manojñayā puṣkarekṣaṇa

The gopis describe that "brahmaṇā śṛṇoti". What is that? In the Gopi Gita, they
are saying that when we hear You. "madhurayā girā". You know. Your voice is so
sweet. And then, with it, with that voice, "valgu-vākyayā". The words that You
speak are also so charming. You know. And, and they are so charm... , this
combination of sweet voice and charming words, what does it do?
"budha-manojñayā". That even the wise become bewildered by it. Even the wise
become attracted. Even their minds become captivated by it. So, you know, that
is the real life in the spiritual world where there is reciprocation. Between
the living entity and the Supreme Lord. Now, Srila Prabhupada further explains
in his purport that, you know, you know, you know, you know, Prabhupada quotes
from "smṛti".

        vasanti yatra puruṣāḥ sarve vaikuṇṭha-mūrtayaḥ

So, "vasanti". "vasanti" means reside. "yatra". "yatra". What, what is this
"yatra" referring to? This is referring to the spiritual world. "puruṣāḥ sarve".
All, you know, you know, the, the, all the forms of Supreme Lord.
"vaikuṇṭha-mūrtayaḥ". You know. So, you know, so, not all forms of Supreme Lord.
All the persons over there. "vaikuṇṭha-mūrtayaḥ". So, everybody in the spiritual
world has a "vaikuṇṭha-mūrti", means has a form. Which is, you know, the form of
the Su..., you know, Su..., which akin to the form of the Supreme Lord. So,
"vaikuṇṭha-mūrtayaḥ". So, that means four-handed forms. So, all of them has a
four-handed form. Of course, Vishnu has some distinctive characteristics. That
Vishnu alone has the, you know, you know, you know, has the caustubajwell. But
there are other forms, also. Now, you know, beyond that, Prabhupada also
mention, the point is, you know, Prabhupada explain that how they they are
"sanātanaḥ". And that they cannot be cut. What I explained earlier. And then,
Prabhupada gives the example that how are we parts?

"just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold."

So, like that, we are also God in the sense that we are parts of God. So, we are
godly. We cannot be God in an entirety. So, now, you know, you know, you know,
after looking at these two parts, so, first part is saying that we are eternally
parts of Krishna. And second part is saying that, you know, whe..., when we
disconnect, we become disconnected from Krishna. Then, we come under the spell
of the mind and senses. And then, we suffer. We struggle and suffer. You know.
So, as "karṣati". So, the seco..., two parts basically can be integrated by the
phrase, you know, be a part. Be not apart. Be a part. Let us live as a part of
Krishna. We are parts of Krishna. Let us cooperate with Krishna. And by living
in harmony with the whole, we will get happiness. You know. The wonderful thing
about Krishna Consciousness is that, although as souls, we are limited. But our
happiness does not have to be limited. You know. You know. We are limited. So,
if we are i..., seeking happiness independently of Krishna. Then, our happiness
will be limited. But if we connect with Krishna, then, the happiness that we can
get can be unlimited, also. Because Krishna is all-attractive. And Krishna is
infinite. So, connection with Him can give us happiness forever. And ever. And
ever. And that is how, you know, you know, soul, we do not have to necessarily
be, you know, you know, li..., limited by our finiteness in terms of our
capacity to experience happiness. So, that is the wonderful part of Krishna. So,
be a part. So, it is not something that we have to become a slave of Krishna.
No. Actually, what it essentially means is that we have to serve Krishna. And we
serve Krishna according to our, you know, individuality. Even in the spiritual
world. And that pleases Krishna. And He reciprocates. And then, there is supreme
joy over there. So, you know, you know, being a part of Krishna is a natural
aspect of our spiritual lives. You know. That is our nature, actually. It is not
something we have to do. But our current situation is unnatural. So, be a part.
Be not apart. But instead of being a part. A part is two words. A part. But now,
instead of that, we are A. P. A..., A. P. A. R. T. One word. Apart. We become
apart from Krishna. And when we become apart from Krishna, then "karṣati". We
suffer. Because nothing can satisfy us. Ultimately, the Sup..., Sup..., Supreme
is one. By definition, Supreme means one. And there cannot be any substitute for
the Supreme. So, in this world, the mind and senses are offering us various
objects for enjoyment. Objects that, you know, that promises to be sub..., that
promises substitutes. So, ok. Why don't you enjoy this? Why don't you enjoy
that? Why don't you that? But actually, we cannot enjoy any of those things. So,
therefore, the, you know, you know, sufferings in this world are inevitable.
They are created by the, they are created by the, you know, sou..., our own
karma. But then, we, also, when we are entangled with the mind and senses, we
also do further bad karma. Which causes even greater suffering. So, in this way,
there is suffering. So, the first part. And the second part is, first part is
telling this is the nature of the soul. Liberated. As a part of Krishna. But
then, when the soul does not act at the liberated platform, then the soul
undergoes "karṣati". Undergoes the struggle of material existence. So, what is
that "karṣati"? That will be explained in the next verse. You know. So, let us
look at the next verse. You know.

        śarīraṁ yad avāpnoti
        yac cāpy utkrāmatīśvaraḥ
        gṛhītvaitāni saṁyāti
        vāyur gandhān ivāśayāt

So, "śarīraṁ yad avāpnoti". One gets the "śarīraṁ". You know. What kind of
"śarīraṁ"? One. One. "avāpnoti". That will depend on one's karma. "yac cāpy
utkrāmatīśvaraḥ". You know. You know. "utkrāmati". "utkrāmati" means one gives
up. Departs from the body. So, it is "īśvaraḥ". So, the soul is the "īśvaraḥ".
Why is the soul considered to be "īśvaraḥ"? You know.

        gṛhītvaitāni saṁyāti
        vāyur gandhān ivāśayāt

So, "gṛhītvaitāni". So, "īśvaraḥ", we will discuss a little later. Let us look at
the sanskrit verse. "gṛhītvaitāni". So, "gṛhītvā" is to take up. "saṁyāti" is to
give up. You know. "vāyur gandhān ivāśayāt". So, you know, you know, you know,
what is "vāyur gandhān"? "vāyur" is, you know, fra..., fragrance. Or aroma. Or
smell. So, that "vāyur" is wind. And "gandhān" is fragrance. Or aroma. Smell.
"ivāśayāt". So, "āśayāt" is the source. So, the example that is given is that,
you know, when wind is blowing. So, if the wind blows to a, you know, fragrant
flower garden, you know, then the wind will carry that fragrance. But if the
wind goes through the area of outhouse. Where there is the pan..., there is the
repellent order of excreta. Then, when one, the wind goes through that, the wind
will acquire that order. So, similarly, the soul acquires different conceptions.
Different conceptions of what is life. What is, how is life meant to be enjoyed.
So, some people are sadists. You know. Sadists means that by causing others
pain, they get pleasure. You know. They, the more if somebody causes pain. And
there is some people. You know. They, they want to see. They may, you know, take
ants. And they pour scalding hot water on the ants. And when they see, a...,
a..., a..., the ant is suffering. And they get some pleasure in that. 31:16
