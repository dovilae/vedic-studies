Hare Krishna. Welcome back to the Bhakti Shastri course. We are now in the
middle of the 19 Chapters of "The Nectar of Devotion". Let us begin with the
Tenth Chapter. You know. We are discussing the 64 items of devotional service.
And this chapter, Srila Prabhupada titles as the "Techniques of Hearing and
Remembering". So, in "The Nectar of Devotion" itself, you know, the division is
differently. It is primarily in terms of Eastern side. Western side. And within
that, there are waves. So, this, these chapter division is primarily Srila
Prabhupada's, you know, division. And the titles are also given by him. So,
here, you know, basically, there are primarily, talking about "śravaṇaṁ". And
then, "smaraṇaṁ". Some other, this is "Tat-kṛpāpekṣaṇam". Expecting the Lord's
mercy. Then, there is, this is "smaraṇaṁ". And "mananam". This is re..., this,
this is remembrance. And this is deeper remembrance. That is meditation. So, we
look at each of these one by one. "śravaṇaṁ" is the first among the processes of
devotional service. As described by "Prahlāda Mahārāja". So:

        śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ
        smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam

"śravaṇaṁ". So, it is the first. And basically, "śravaṇaṁ" means that we hear
from advanced devotees. And there are three references given over here. And the
"śravaṇaṁ" can be of different things. Normally, we think, we, "śravaṇaṁ" means
hearing of Krishna Katha. But actually, even kirtan, that is there. You know.
When Krishna, when advanced devotees sing Krishna's names, even hearing them
singing, that is also "śravaṇaṁ". Of course, generally, when that happens, there
is kirtanam, also. That means, the advanced devotees sing the kirtan. And then,
we repeat it. So, that is why it can be called kirtan. But "śravaṇaṁ" applies to
that, also. When we hear, we hear not only the spea..., pure devotees speak about
Krishna. But when they sing about Krishna, hearing that, also, is purifying. So,
here, we will see, three references are given. And each of these talks about
one-one specific, you know, you know, different theme. So, there can be nama
"śravaṇaṁ". There can be carita "śravaṇaṁ". And then, there can be guna adi
"śravaṇaṁ". So, nama "śravaṇaṁ" means, let us look at this, nama "śravaṇaṁ"
means hearing about the holy name. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, he gives the
example from the "Garuḍa Purāṇa" over here. That as just a person who is
unconscious that there can be, you know, because of a snake bite. That
unconsciousness can be, you know, recover..., rec..., recountered. And the
person can be brought back to consciousness by the sound of mantras. So,
similarly, we are all spiritually unconscious. We are, you know, bitten by the
snake of illusion.

        samsara-sarpa-visha-digdha mahogra-tivra
        damstragra-koti-paridashta vinashta-murte
        nagari-vahana sudhabdhi-nivasa shaure
        lakshmi-nrisimha mama dehi karavalambam

So, this metaphor of material existence being compared to a snake bite is quite
common. And this verse, which are recited, it is different from the "Garuḍa
Purāṇa", "Purāṇa" reference. But the point is similar that material existence is
like a snake bite. "samsara-sarpa". So, "samsara". Like a "sarpa".
"visha-digdha". Very poisonous. "mahogra-tivra". Extremely frightening. And
"ugra". "ugra" is horrible. And "tivra" is very sharp. "mahogra-tivra".
"damstragra". "damstra" is teeth. "agra" is the front part. Sharp fangs are
there. And how many fangs are there? Normally, even if a snake has one fang, it
is dangerous. If it has four fangs, it is even more dangerous. But this has
"koti-paridashta". "murte". "koti". Actually, practically, every alluring sense
object is like a fang of material existence. Because what does that sense object
do? When we, "dhyāyato viṣayān puṁsaḥ". When we meditate on the sense object,
then, tuck, the enjoying mentality gets injected into our consciousness. And
that enjoying mentality poisons our spiritual awareness. And the more a person
gets injected with the enjoying mentality, the more that person becomes
unconscious of spiritual reality. So, all of us are in that way unconscious.
Because not only in this life, but even in previous lives, we have been bitten
by so many snake bites. And, you know, you know, some of the examples that are
given in the scriptures, we may not be able to immediately comprehend them.
Because we live in a different culture. So, we normally, if there is somebody
who gets a snake bite, normally, we will go to a doctor. And we will get an
antidote. And some injection will be given. That is how we will cure it. But in
the Vedic culture, it is understood that sound has a connection with everything.
And the connection of sound with, you know, you know, the connection of sound
with, you know, the effect on the body is something which is being increasingly
researched by scientists. So, we know that, just as the sound can pacify, you
know, a person. You know. When we, when people are agitated, people whom hear
music. Not even just devotees hearing devotional music. But even materialistic
people. If they hear some coo..., relaxing music, they feel relaxed. In fact,
they call it as a relaxing music. So, sound affects. Sound has affects. Subtle
affects. So, one of the affects of sound is that when a person is poisoned,
actually, by spe..., cha..., chanting specific mantras, that affect of poison
can be countered. You know. It is a subtl..., it is very subtle. And it is not
ordinary. You know. There are specific sounds need to be chanted in a specific
way. Then, the poison gets countered out. So, that, that, that is an example
which we are not be able to comprehend immediately. You know. But the principle,
we can understand. That just an unconscious person can be brought back to
consciousness in that case of a snake bite, through a mantra, similarly, by the
chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra, a person can be brought back from
unconsciousness to consciousness. So, this is an example of nama "śravaṇaṁ".
That means hearing about the name, hearing the name of Krishna. So, there can be
different kinds of hearing. Let us look at the next reference now. So, in the
reference, you know, "Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam", it is "Mahā...", "Śukadeva Gosvāmī"
telling "Parīkṣit Mahārāja". And it is, this is about tra..., speak about the
transcendental activities of the Lord. So, this is carita, adi "śravaṇaṁ",
carita "śravaṇaṁ". The character of the Lord. The pastimes of the Lord. The
transcendental activities. So, you know, so, it says, just like from the
moonlike faces of great devotees, what should happens?

This is a nectarian river flowing. And one hears it. And by that, one becomes
free from material miseries. And then, Prabhupada quo..., gives general
philosophically background to explain how hearing is important. And then,
lastly, this is guna adi "śravaṇaṁ". So, hear, this is a, hear about the
transcendental qualities about the Lord. Now, this is a small differentiation.
It is not a very serious, you know, differentiation in the sense that there can
be overlapping categories. But we can generally understand that there is nama
"śravaṇaṁ". There is carita adi "śravaṇaṁ". And there is guna "śravaṇaṁ". So,
these are all related with the Supreme Lord. And there may be some, there, there
is a continuity, also. And there is a distinctiveness, also, in it. The
essential point is hearing about Krishna is extremely important. And, you know,
in the "Caitanya-caritāmṛta", where Lord Chaitanya is intri..., exa..., is
instructing the goswamis, he describes how hearing and chanting is like watering
the, you know, "bhakti-latā-bīja". So that it, once it starts growing, then
also, it needs water.

        śravaṇa-kīrtana ... secana

He says. It is "secana". It is watering the tree. You know. Watering the
"bhakti-latā". The creeper of devotion. Now, after this, the next item is
expecting the mercy of the Lord. That is "Tat-kṛpāpekṣaṇam". "Tat-kṛpā".
"Tat-kṛpā" of the Lord. You know. Expecting it. Now, this is interesting.
"Tat-kṛpāpekṣaṇam" means what? Actually, if we understand that bhakti is a path
of grace. We cannot make spiritual advancement just by our endeavors. Our
endeavors are no doubt very important. Very, very important. But along with
doing our endeavors, we also need, you know, Krishna's mercy. Our endeavors are
basically to show Krishna that we want His mercy. So, as devotees, we expect
Lord's mercy. So, the example often is given of "cātaka" bird. How it waits for
the water to come from the sky. And when the water comes from the sky, it gets
nourishment by that. There, all the water is available, elsewhere, it does not
take. So, like that, a devotee expects the Lord's mercy. And here, "Rūpa
Gosvāmī" quotes the famous verse from, you know, the prayers of Brahmaji in the
Tenth Canto.

        tat te ’nukampāṁ su-samīkṣamāṇo
        bhuñjāna evātma-kṛtaṁ vipākam
        hṛd-vāg-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te
        jīveta yo mukti-pade sa dāya-bhāk

So, "tat te ’nukampāṁ". That your "anukampām". Your mercy. "su-samīkṣamāṇo".
"īkṣamāṇo" is, is, eyeing. Waiting for. "bhuñjāna evātma-kṛtaṁ vipākam".
"bhuñjāna". "bhuñjāna" means undergoing. One is undergoing various, when
a devotee is suffering, undergoing miseries, what does devotee? "ātma-kṛtaṁ
vipākam". One thinks, this "ātma-kṛtaṁ". It is because of my own bad deeds that
I am getting the reactions now. So, devotee thinks just as karmic sufferings are
coming, because of my own misdeeds. But what is Krishna's mercy? Krishna is
minimising those sufferings for me. So, Krishna is just giving me a sample. And
moreover, Krishna is giving me His remembrance, by which I can shield myself
from those sufferings. And I can go deeper into taking His shelter. Into His
remembrance. And then, you know, "hṛd-vāg-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te". "namas
te". "namas te" means offer obeisances. how? "hṛd-vāg-vapurbhir". "hṛd" is the
heart. "vāg" is speech. "vapur" is body. So, completely. With, you know, body.
Speech. And heart. One utterly offers obeisances. "hṛd-vāg-vapurbhir vidadhan
namas te". And "jīveta yo". One who lives like this, "mukti-pade sa dāya-bhāk".
"mukti-pade". For liberation. "dāya-bhāk" means Pra..., Pra..., this is,
Prabhupada translated this as, "dāya-bhāk" means inh..., inheritance. So,
liberation has become the inheritance of such a person. Just like if a person is
a, is the child of a billionaire. Then, whatever is the billionaire's property,
the, of, child is going to inherit it. What does the child have to do? Just, the
child has to live. The child just lives, then, then it, then inheritance will
come. Similarl, we just have to live in bhakti. Now, the tribulations that come
in life, may make us feel like giving up bhakti. But then, you know, we have, we
have this devotional disposition. My dear Lord, please, have mercy on me. I am,
I am so fallen. Please have mercy on me. So, that "Tat-kṛpāpekṣaṇam". Begging
for the mercy of the Lord. Srila Prabhupada was once in a morning walk. And at
that time, they passed by a, you know, lake. And there were some birds in the
lake. And there was a man who was feeding those birds. And then, he was throwing
some food crumbs at all the birds. And all the birds doing, were quacking.
Asking for more and more food crumbs. And he was giving to all of them. And
there was one bird which was quacking very fiercely. Very fervently. Repeatedly.
Again. And again. And the bird was quacking more. And more. And more. You know.
Much more than the other birds. And this man was giving more food crumbs to that
bird. So, Prabhupada said this is how mercy is given. He said, actually, you
know, none of the birds can make any demands. This person is completely free to
give, you know, the coo..., food, whoever, whichever bird he wants. And he is
just completely free not to give to anyone, also. He is not bound to give. And
then, he can give to anyone. Is free. But then, why is this person giving more
to this bird? Because this bird is calling out more. And more. Calling out more.
And more. So, like that, when we sincerely, urgently call out to Krishna, then,
you know, Krishna bestows His mercy. "Tat-kṛpāpekṣaṇam". So, of course, when
there is, we, with, there, when, we the devotee asks for the mercy, also, the
devotee feel..., I am, you know, at one level, we understand Krishna has already
given me the mercy. What is the mercy? The very opportunity, to practice
devotional service itself is a great mercy. The very opportunity, to be in the
association of devotees itself is a great mercy. Along with that, as I, you
know, can, as I get myself absorbed in devotion. As I get taste in devotion,
that is a greater mercy. So, a devotee is grateful for whatever mercy has been
given. And devotee wants, longs for more and more mercy. But then, wri..., Srila
Prabhupada writes in the Third Canto, also, the devotee desires. But does not
demand the mercy of the Lord. You know. Desire is natural. Because we have
devotion. Or we want to have devotion. Naturally, we want, you know, the mercy
of the Lord. But at the same time, a devotee does not demand. Demanding is not
in the mood of devotion. Krishna is the master. And we are the servant. Whenever
He wants, He will give. But surely, we long for it. And we express that longing
through our, you know, you know, sincere, urgent calling out. Now, that
calling out is, of course, when we are chanting, we chant urgent, seriously.
That is just one way of calling out. But actually, our whole life can be a
calling out to Krishna. When we do our service 14:18
