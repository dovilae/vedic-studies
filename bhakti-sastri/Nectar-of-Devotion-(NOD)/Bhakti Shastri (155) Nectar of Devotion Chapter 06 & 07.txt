        śrī-caitanya-mano-'bhīṣṭaḿ sthāpitaḿ yena bhū-tale
        svayaḿ rūpaḥ kadā mahyaḿ dadāti sva-padāntikam

Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhakti Shastri course. "Nectar of Devotion".
Now, we are going to discuss, start our discussion on the 64 items of devotional
service. That have been enlisted by "Rūpa Gosvāmī". So, as we have discussed
repeatedly, you know, the verse.

        nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau sad-dharma-saḿsthāpakau
        
So, "sad-dharma-saḿsthāpakau". So, "Rūpa Gosvāmī" wanted to establish
"sad-dharma". Now, "sad-dharma" means, the, is, the true "dharma" is pure
devotional service. So, he has talked about it until now. About how it is
glorious in terms of its six characteristics. He has talked about how it is
glorious in terms of it being independent. And how it is glorious in terms of it
cannot be obtained by anything else. It has to be obtained by bhakti itself. By
devotion, coming from a devotee's mercy. You know. You know. So, that way, he
has talked about the glory of bhakti. In many wa..., in many ways, we can say,
this analysis, forward analysis, has established the supremacy of bhakti. That
bhakti is superior to liberation. Bhakti gives supreme, you know, freedom from
misery. Bhakti is not dependent on any other process. So, all this is the glory
of bhakti. Now, "Rūpa Gosvāmī" is starting to talk about how to practice bhakti.
So, in this, there will not be much, you know, philosophical analysis. But it
will be statement. And scripture establishing statement. For example, if "Rūpa
Gosvāmī" says, ok, we should do this. Then, he will give some scriptural
references to tell, why, you know, ok, this is what the scripture is saying.
This, we should say this. For example, say, we should accept the garlands that
have been offered to the Lord. And acc..., and, and, you know, che..., cherish
them as the prasad of the Lord. Then, he will, gives a, say, a quote from
Uddhava Gita. Where Uddhava is saying this to Lord Krishna. So, like that, the
preven..., when Prabhupada uses the word evidencies regarding devotional
service, what he means is, the word evidence means scriptural evidence. So, you
know, you know, the principle is given, you know, the, by "Rūpa Gosvāmī". The
particular item of devotional service. And then, from various scriptures, he has
given the references to support that principle. So, now, what does it mean? It
means that, you know, bhakti has been practiced for a long, long time. And, you
know, what "Rūpa Gosvāmī" is doing is not something new. He is compiling the
items of bhakti together. So that for us, sadhakas, we will know, what all we
can, how we can practice bhakti. Now, we will see, as we move forward through
these items, how Srila Prabhupada has incorporated many, many of these items
within the Krishna Consciousness movement. Now, there are elements of bhakti.
And there are, the items of affair. And there are some items which are extremely
important. The five potent forms of devotional service. And those, Srila
Prabhupada has in..., incorporated very emphatically in ISKCON. So, not all the
64 items, we will be able to practice with equal frequency. But the idea is
that, the more we are able to practice, the more we will, that, that means these
are all avenues by which we can connect with Krishna. So, ok, this is also one
item by which we can connect to Krishna. This is also one item by which we can.
Like that, there are many items by which we can connect with Krishna. So, you
know, let us look at these items now. You know. So, he starts with
"guru-padashraya". Yeah. You know. So, here, we will see taking shelter of the
spiritual master. Now, actually, if we see, the first five items are almost
related with the same point. They are progressive. I will explain the sequence.
The progression in them. And then, we will discuss each of them. "Guru
padaasraya" means going to a guru. And taking shelter of the feet of the guru.
Then, after we take shelter of the guru, "Sri-krsna - diksadi siksanam". That
means, one takes initiation from the guru. And then, starts, you know, getting
siksa. Starts learning from the spiritual master. In a more systematic way. And
then, we are not just meant to learn from the spiritual master. We are also
meant to serve the spiritual master. And serve the spiritual master with, with
reverence. With, you know, with, with great respects. So, and with affection
come reverence.

So, "Visrambhena". "Visrambhena" means affection. And reverence. "guroh seva".
And then, "Sadhu-vartmanu vartanam". You know. "sadhu" refers to, now, we have
the common, you know, guru-sadhu-sastra tripod. So, "sadhu" refers to other
acharyas. Apart from the spiritual master. So, so, we have to follow, not just
the spiritual master. "vartmanu vartanam". "vartmanu" mean..., "vartanam" is,
you know, you know:

        mama vartmānuvartante

Krishna has used this phrase in the Bhagavad Gita, also. Twice. You know. So,
you know, you know, "vartma" is path. "anuvartante", "ānuvartanam" is to follow
according to path. So, to follow in the footsteps of the saintly path. That
means we learn from others, also. And, not just the spiritual master. And then,
"Sad-dharmma-prccha". "Sad-dharmma-prccha" means we acquire about the principles
of religion. And we ask questions from the spiritual master. And that is how we
learn. So, these are the five items. You know. So, now, Srila Prabhupada gives
the, these are the sanskrit which are given in the "Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu".
Srila Prabhupada, you know, in his, you know, format of summary study,
generally, does not go into the sanskrits too much. There is, sanskrit too much.
Just like in Krsna Book, also, he does not quote the sanskrit verses. Even when
he is, you know, he does not quote the sanskrit verses for the Tenth Canto
itself. And even when he is giving references to substantiate some of the points
which he is making. You know. In his interspersed, you know, comments. He
does not, you know, generally, quote the sanskrit over there. Summary study,
Prabhupada keeps things simple for the, and accessible for the people. So, here,
to really help us, you know, gain a clearer understanding. And, and to help us
gain a proper perspective. And also giving the sanskrit from, based on the
"Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu". And, you know, you know, let us look at the items as
Srila Prabhupada has described it. Based on, you know, you know, "Rūpa", you
know, "Rūpa Gosvāmī"'s list. So, here, we will see, you know, yeah, you know,
so, let us look at these quickly. "ACCEPTING THE SHELTER OF A BONA FIDE
SPIRITUAL MASTER". So, now, here, we will see one aspect of Srila Prabhupada.
That when Prabhupada gives, you know, the translations of those verses. He
actually integrates the translation. And the purport. So, you know, you know,
the transla..., so, the, if we look at the translation of 11.3.21. It is a very
short translation. And this also helps us understand how Srila Prabhupada is
working. You know. You know. Let us try to understand quickly. It is an
interesting exercise for us to understand Srila Prabhupada's compassion. You
know. So, this is, 11.3.21. So, the, it, this is the translation.

"Therefore any person who seriously desires real happiness must seek a bona fide
spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. The qualification of the
bona fide guru is that he has realized the conclusions of the scriptures by
deliberation and is able to convince others of these conclusions. Such great
personalities, who have taken shelter of the Supreme Godhead, leaving aside all
material considerations, should be understood to be bona fide spiritual
masters."

So, actually, you know, you know, this is the Eleventh, now, tasma..., if we
look at the original sanskrit, this is also, it is an elaborate translation. So,
if we look at the sanskrit, it says:

        tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta

Therefore, surrender to guru. "tasmād". Now:

        jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam

"jijñāsuḥ". What, a person who is enquiring. And what is that person enquiring
about? Not just ordinary things. You know. What is the cricket score? What is
the price of the stock, what is the rate of the stock market? What is the price
of the vegetables? No.

        jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam

Long-term. The ultimate good. "śreya" refers to long-term or ultimate. And
"uttamam" is, "tamam" is darkness. "uttamam" is that which is beyond darkness.
That which is transcendental. "jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam".

        śābde pare ca niṣṇātaṁ

And what kind of guru should that be? "śābde pare". That the "niṣṇātaṁ". That in
the transcendental worlds is "niṣṇātaṁ". Is perfectly knowledgeable. In the
transcendental words. And:

        brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam

He is not only learned in the scripture. But he is also "upaśamāśrayam", has
taken shelter of the Brahman platform. That means has "upaśamāśrayam", is
"upaśama-āśrayam". Is distur..., detached from material things. And is attached
to the Supreme Lord. So, now, this is the sanskrit. It is, it is such a short
verse, we can say. But let us look at, understand Srila Prabhupada's compassion.
In which, he is elaborately explaining, integrating translation and purport
together. So, what is Prabhupada say? This is a conversation between "Prabuddha"
and "Mahārāja Nimi".

“My dear King, please know for certain that in the material world there is no
happiness. It is simply a mistake to think that there is happiness here, because
this place is full of nothing but miserable conditions.”

So, now, all this, now, we may say where is all this in the translation? In the
verse. If we look at the verse over here. There is nothing like this. No
happiness in the material world. And everything. So, why does it? Actually, it
is all, Srila Prabhupada's purport of this word, "tasmād". "tasmād". So,
therefore, take shelter of the guru. What does therefore mean? Just like we have
"athāto". You know. We have:

        athāto brahma-jijñāsā

So, what does "athāto" mean? So, Srila Prabhupada explains "athāto" to me.
"athā...", now, inquire about Brahman. So, what does now refer to? Ex...,
Prabhupada explains that now that we have got a human form life, now, inquire
about Brahman. So, sim..., so, like that, Srila Prabhupada is incorporating
this, lot of philosophical substance. You know. In, unpacking even every word.
And he, in, because it is a summary study, so, Srila Prabhupada's focus is on
giving, you know, what is necessary for the audience. So, he takes the
scripture. And he integrates the translation with the purport in a way that
expresses the compassion of his heart. By sharing with us, what we need to do.
So, most people may, people may think that, oh, guru, why should I have a guru?
It is a fashion to have a guru. No. That, for, it, to go to a guru, if we
seriously want benefit from the guru. Then, we understand that, actually, this
world is a place of misery. And at a material level, the misery cannot be
rectified. If I want to rectify the misery, then I have to rise to the
transcendental level. So, "tasmād". Therefore. So, Srila Prabhupada unpacks
"tasmāt" as, you know, so, there is no happiness in the material world. And
the:

"It is simply a mistake to think that there is happiness here, because this
place is full of nothing but miserable conditions."

And then, "tasmād". He moves forward.

"Any person who is seriously desirous of achieving real happiness must seek out
a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation."

So:

        tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta
        jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam

So, "jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam". What is the "jijñāsuḥ śreya"? Of, you know,
Prabhupada translate, "desirous of achieving real happiness". You know.
"jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam". And "prapadyeta". Prabhupada translates that as "take
shelter of him by initiation". Now:

        śābde pare ca niṣṇātaṁ
        brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam

Let us see how Srila Prabhupada translate this now. Or rather, he translates and
comments in a combined way over here.

"The qualification of a spiritual master is that he must have realized the
conclusion of the scriptures by deliberation and arguments and thus be able to
convince others of these conclusions."

So, "śābde pare ca niṣṇātaṁ". You know. You know. So, "pare", "śābde pare ca
niṣṇātaṁ", Prabhupada translates this two things. Realised the conclusions. And
capable of conclu..., convincing others of those conclusions.

"Such great personalities who have taken shelter of the Supreme Godhead,"

        brahmaṇy upaśamā...

"brahmaṇy". Such a, such a spiritual scenario.

"upaśamāśrayam". I am giving up all other things.

"leaving aside all material considerations, are to be understood as bona fide
spiritual masters. Everyone should try to find such a bona fide spiritual master
in order to fulfill his mission of life, which is to transfer himself to the
plane of spiritual bliss.”

So, so much, Srila Prabhupada is giving us. What is the mission of human life.
To transfer oneself to the plane of spiritual bliss. You know. You know. Then,
now, Srila, after that, Srila Prabhupada goes into explaining. Again, he is
looking at the context. You know. "The Nectar of Devotion" is a book which is
written 500 years ago. And Srila Prabhupada is translating it, not just in terms
of the, you know, language. He is translating it in terms of the context, also.
You know. Today, there is this situation where there is so many people claim to
be gurus. And so many people who easily get mislead. So, therefore, Srila
Prabhupada, you know, translates, you know, Prabhu..., in his explanations. He
explain, he talks about the qualification of a bonafide guru. And how a guru,
you know, one should select a properly qualified guru. And not an unqualified
guru. So, this is Srila Prabhupada's comment about, you know, the, you know,
first element. "guru-padashraya". So, Srila Prabhupada is giving us firstly, you
know, why one should take, take shelter of guru. "Śrī Jīva". "Rūpa Gosvāmī" is
simply giving the item, take shelter of guru. But first, he says why? Because
this world is a place of misery. And the guru can, shows the way out of misery.
Then, he is telling, also, what, what is the kind of guru that we should take
shelter of? So, "guru-padashraya". So, why take "ashraya"? And what is the guru?
And that, also, Prabhupada describes. So, in this way, Srila Prabhupada unpacks
that for us. And then, after unpacking it, then he moves unto the next item.
Now, what Srila Prabhupada has done over here is, "Rūpa Gosvāmī" has just given
"guru-padashraya". And after that, he has simply said "tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta".
He gives this as an example. Ok. This is the word. This is the item. And this is
the ref..., reference. This is an example for it. And Prabhupada elaborates
further for our understanding. Now, after that "sri":

        kṛṣṇa-dīkṣādi-śikṣaṇam

"sri", "kṛṣṇa-dīkṣā". So that one has to take "dīkṣā". And then, "śikṣaṇam". One
has to learn from it. So, actually, our parampara is primarily a "śikṣa"
parampara. You know. Sri, it, it, you know, if we look at the history of our
sampradaya, "Rūpa Gosvāmī" himself, you know, if there is no mention in the
"Caitanya-caritāmṛta", or any other "Caitanya", of any of the other literature
like that. That Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did a fire sacrifice to initiate
"Rūpa" and "Sanātana Gosvāmī". Now, actually, "Rūpa" and "Sanātana Gosvāmī"
first corresponded with Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. They asked him. You know. We are
trapped in such a miserable situation. Where we have to serve "mleccha", you
know, "mleccha"s. How, how can we be delivered? And then, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu
was moved by the sincere, you know, you know, sincerity within the, in their
letters. And while going to North India, he came to "Rāmakeli". And they came at
night. Secretly meet him. And they, oh, f..., surrendered their life to him. You
know. "Jīva Gosvāmī" was their nephew. Little "Jīva" at that time. He also came
secretly. And he saw how, with complete humility, and, you know, you know, utter
surrender, his uncles offered themselves to the feet of Lord Chaitanya. You
know. You know. So, that way, you know, basically, "Rūpa" and "Sanātana", they
have surrendered at that time. Now, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was actually traveling
with his associates on harinaam sankirtana. So, there was no, you know,
content, no place over there for him to do any diksha. And then, after that, he
went it, he meet him, he met, met "Rūpa" and "Sanātana Gosvāmī" in, you know,
"Varanasi". And, you know, "Vara...", that area when, the, he was in North
India. And they had left home. And come. And then, again, "Rūpa" and "Sanātana
Gosvāmī" once came to Puri when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was leaving. So, they came,
so, like that, there were a few meetings. That is, were all the meetings that
were there. But what happened? They completely offered their heart and life to
Lord Chaitanya. Just based on these meetings. Now, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu gave
elaborate instructions in, you know, in, you know, "Varanasi". You know. To
these two. "Varanasi". You know. To these two great souls. ""Rūpa" and "Sanātana
Gosvāmī". So, basically, it was dik..., so, is, diksha was more in the heart.
And then, there was siksha. There was transmission of instruction. So, now, the
essence is siksha. But that, you know, the sta..., that essence of siksha is
formulised. So that both parties become aware of the seriousness of what is
happening. So, for us, we, Srila Prabhupada, and before him, Srila
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura had proper diksha ceremonies. Where fire
sacrifice was down. And the spiritual master, the, the disciple comes forward.
And makes vo..., takes vows. And the disciple, and the guru gives a new name.
All this was done. Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu of course gave a new name to them.
So, in that sense, we could say that, he, that was the diksha for them. You
know. So, what is, the important point is, "sri":

        kṛṣṇa-dīkṣādi-śikṣaṇam

So, "dīkṣādi-śikṣaṇam". So, "sik...", the "śikṣaṇam" is the important. And in
that, diksha is also included. 18:06
