Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhakti Shastri, "Nectar of Devotion" classes.
Now, we are discussing the six characteristic of devotional service. So, in the
previous class, we discussed about, you know, about the quality of devotional
service to free us from misery. "Klesaghni". So, let us quickly recap that. And
then, we will move forward to the next discussion. You know. You know. So, here,
we will just, yeah, you know, so, we have discussed this. I will not repeat
this. But I just quickly summarise it here. We discussed how our suffering
origintes in ignorance. That is "avidyā". And then, it moves on to "kutam". It
creates a sinful proclivity within us. Which leads to sinful desires. That is
"bijam". Then, we do "papam". Then, or, or we do "punya", also. Whichever way it
is, then that reaction to "papam" or "punya" accumulates us the "aprārabdha".
The unmanifest sinful reactions. The unmanifest sinful reactions become, you
know, manifest as "prārabdha". And then, we undergo suffering or enjoyment. You
know. You know. So, now, of course, the "aprārabdha" also cycles back. And
because what, when we do some sinful activity, that sinful activity also creates
the sinful proclivity again. So, that is how this becomes a cycle. So, how does
bhakti counter it? Bhakti, we discussed, "avidyā" is uprooted. You know. So, how
it is countered, I have written in the red words over here. "avidyā" is
uprooted. Ignorance is removed because Krishna personally gives knowledge and
bhakti illumines us.

        dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ

Like that. Then, "kutam" is countered. Because even the sinful desires that we
do not know, they are flooded out of our heart by the process of bhakti. So,
"bijam", you know, is nullified. Nullified means, the sinful desires that we
ha..., may have, you know, which we have been indulging in the past, also. Those
desires, we realise that, they do not give me any real happiness. There is a far
greater happiness available in devotional service. And those desires become
undesirable. As Krishna uses the word, "na kāma-kāmī". One is no longer the
desirer of des..., desirer of desires. And as far as the suffering is concerned,
the suffering is, you know, irradicated. Or transcended. So, irradicated or
transcended means, you know, that either the suffering is, Krishna says:

        ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
        mokṣayiṣyāmi ...

So, the suffering is either, you know, transcend..., eradicted. Krishna just
takes away the sinful re..., sin, reactions to, from us. The suffer..., Krishna
does not get the suffering come. And even if some sufferring has a, residue
comes along, a devotee transcends that suffering. Why? Because bhakti gives us
the higher taste. The remembrance of Krishna enables us to go beyond suffering.

        mad-āśrayāḥ kathā mṛṣṭāḥ
        śṛṇvanti kathayanti ca
        tapanti vividhās tāpā
        naitān mad-gata-cetasaḥ

The, in the third Canto of "Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam". Lord Kapila Deva describes that
the devotees who take shelter of Him:

        mad-āśrayāḥ kathā mṛṣṭāḥ

My "kathā" is so deliciou..., you know, cor..., relishable that:

        śṛṇvanti kathayanti ca

They hear. And chant. Hear. And speak about it. And by that, you know, although:

        tapanti vividhās tāpā

Although various miseries come, those miseries do not afflict the devotees.
Because we:

        naitān mad-gata-cetasaḥ

Their consciousness is not in that situation. Their consciousness is high above
that situation. Just, you know, like outside, it may be very hot, we have given
this example several times. But if a person comes in the AC room, then the
person does not feel the heat. So, like that, a devotee, by absorption in
Krishna also transcends suffering. So, of course, bhakti eradicates suffering.
Oh, and in that way, a devot..., bhakti is "Klesaghni". So, you know, you know,
now, after "Klesaghni", the next characteristic is "Subhada". "Subhada" means
auspicious. Not just auspicious. But all-auspicious. So, now, Srila Prabhupada
explains what is the nature of all-auspiciousness? That which benefits everyone.
That which attracts everyone. That which produces good qualities. And that which
bestows superior happiness. That is the meaning of auspicious. All-aucpicious.
So, let us look at these one by one. You know. The word auspicious means, now,
what is the difference between "Klesaghni" and auspicious? See, one is to remove
misery. But, you know, just like in a diseased ca..., in a, when a person is
sick, there is one, pick, one part of the disease is removing of the infection.
The second part is the recovery of the energy and the normal health. So,
sometimes, when a person is, the disease has been removed. But the person has
not yet been, has, the, come back to normal health. So, that person is said to
be recuperating. So, it is not that person is sick. But the person needs rest
for recovery. So, like that, you know, you know, here, "Subha...", you know,
"Subh...", all-auspicious means that, you know, there is miseries removed. But
the future, positive happiness is guaranteed. And how does this future, positive
happiness? "Subhada". "Subha" is auspicious. That which gives. How is this
brought about? That is because, you know, the, for it is, for it to be
all-auspicious. Bhakti is all-auspicious. That means when one devotee advances
in devotional service, by that, everyone is benefitted. You know. When we chant
Hare Krishna attentively, you know, we are improving the world. One thought at a
time. Because ultimately, what, you know, what is the, what happens in the world
is determined by people's thoughts, desi..., and desires. Which translate into
actions. And the world is not going to improve by somebody just coming. And
ma..., waving a magic wand. The world is going to improve when then the people
within that are going to improve. And the people are also not going to improve
by some magic wand. People are going to improve when their thoughts and desires
improve. So, bhakti is "Subhada". Because bhakti improves our thoughts. And
desires. Bhakti purifies our, moves our negative thoughts. Selfish thoughts.
Distractive thoughts. And of course, desires correspondingly. Thoughts grow
into desires. And it replaces them with positive, selfless, noble thoughts and
desires. So, bhakti is, you know, "Subhada". So, actually speaking, you know,
bhakti benefits everyone. You know. It is not that, a person, you know, we have
discussed earlier, how, whenever we love some, one thing, then any other thing
apart from Krishna, then that love creates sectarianism. Ok. I love my country.
Then, that means, I am not loving the opposing country. So, if I love India,
then because of my love of India, I may well hate Pakistan. Because I consider
Pakistan as my enemy. Whereas when we love Krishna, we love everyone. You know.
Sometimes, we may say that, ok, devotees also have to fight. Say, you know,
there are opponent, opposition, opponents of devotees. And we have to fight
against them.

So, the Pandavas fought against Kauravas. But then, the Pandavas are still the
well-wishers of the Kauravas. And Lord "Rāma" fought against "Rāvaṇa". But after
"Rāvaṇa" was killed, Lord "Rāma" asked "Vibhīṣaṇa". Insisted, in fact, to
"Vibhīṣaṇa". That he also do the, you know, last rites of, you know, "Rāvaṇa".
Because he said that the soul is pure. And the soul, you know, you know, should
not have any, you know, antipathy. Any hatred for the soul. So, the point is
that bhakti benefits everyone. It benefits everyone. How does it benefit
everyone? Because bhakti directs our love towards Krishna. And purifies our
heart in a way that ultimately we become connected with everyone. So, it
attracts everyone. It benefits everyone. How can it attract everyone? Because
everyone ultimately is a soul. Everyone ultimately is a soul. And, you know,
that soul has, all souls have a natural relationship with Krishna. You know.
Which is just covered presently. And over a period of time, it will become
uncovered. So, by the practice of bhakti, we learn to rise beyond material
things to spiritual things. To spiritual reality. And by rising to spiritual
reality, we experience the supreme happiness. You know. So, you know, you know,
you know, it attract every..., it, it is, it attracts, our, even, it benefits
everyone. So, because everybody has a relationship with Krishna. When everybody
experiences spiritual happiness, then they give up inauspicious activities. And
they become situated in auspiciousness. And it is, it produces good qualities.
You know. So, so, Prabhupada also gives the example of how, you know, just by
practicing devotional service for a few months, young people, who are engaged in
all kinds of, you know, you know, inauspicious activities. You know.
Intoxication. Illicit sex. You know. You know. Meat-eating. Gambling. All sorts
of activities. You know. They give up those, you know, you know, self-defeating
activities. And they develop self-control. They develop, you know, respectful
attitude. Humility. Sensitivity. You know. Of course, their development of these
positive qualities is a progression. But, you know, those qualities are indeed
developed. You know. So:

        yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā
        sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ

"samāsate surāḥ". That actually, for "surāḥ"s. For those who are, you know, the
devatas. You know. As compared to the demons, devatas have many good qualities.
So, you know, one may say, that is why we say that a person ne..., who has good
qualities is godly. You know. So, like that, by the practice of devotion, by
developing devotion, all auspicious qualities develop in a person. Because
essentially, the soul has auspicious qualities. Ju..., and the soul is simply
covered over by the modes of ignorance. You know. By the lower modes. Because of
which, those pure qualities are obscured. And when, you know, a person becomes
purified, then good qualities manifest. And that is how, those good qualities
also become the cause of auspiciousness. You know. When we have good qualities,
naturally, we act positively. And when we act positively, naturally, that brings
positive results for us. So, bhakti is auspicious because it produces good
qualities. And then, it bestows superior happiness. Ultimately, you know,
something, if it is auspicious, if we say that, you know, you know, if we say
that, you know, it does not bring happiness, then the ausiciousness does not
have much meaning. So, bhakti gives supreme happiness. You know. That happiness
of bhakti will be talked several times in "Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu". And we will
discuss it progressively as we move forward. Now, let us look at the references
that "Rūpa Gosvāmī" has given for this. And look at those references one by one,
briefly. So, you know, here, so, we see, Krishna Consciousness is
all-auspicious. You know. So, Prabhupada, you know, translates it, pure
devotional service is Krishna Consciousness. You know. Krishna Consciousness.
And he says, it should be meant, it:

"means welfare activities for all the people of the world."

For all people of all the world. That, so, universally attracted. And Prabhupada
gives example that, that, actually, when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu went, he
benefitted even the animals.

"traveling through the forests of Jhārikhaṇḍa ..."

"The tigers, the elephants, the deer and all the other wild animals joined Him
and were participating, in their own ways, by dancing and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa."

So, Srila Prabhupada would say that, you know, we do not have the potency to
make animals dance. But people who are like hum..., living like animals. They can
be made to dance by the chanting of the holy name. So, Srila Prabhupada actually
did that. So, there is universal benefit by the process of chanting. And by the
process of Krishna Consciousness in general. Chanting in specific. And we see
this that people, who have no knowledge about Krishna, also. They also relish
chanting. And they become attracted by it. So, that is what is being talked
about here. That bhakti gives us supreme happiness. You know. Bhakti is,
actually, attracts everyone. Even non-human beings. What to speak of human
beings. So, when a person becomes a bhakta, we see that the example of
"Jadbharat", also. You know. He was so sensitive that he did not even want to
step on an ant. That is how a person becomes the well-wisher of all living
beings. You know. You know. You know. Then, Srila Prabhupada talks about, you
know, how a devotee gives up all bad activities. And materialistic people, even
the be..., well educated. You know.

"He may be highly educated from the academic point of view, but in the actual
field of his activities he can be seen to be baser than the animals."

You know. Many of these so-called scient..., many of the scientists,
philosophers, who are very respected for the scientific, you know,
contributions. Or even the philosophical insights. So, if we look at the
personal lives, often, they, their personal lives are not marked by very high,
you know, you know, high personal standards in terms of their ability for
self-mastery. You know. They sometimes had illicit affairs. They may, some of, 
some famous authors, they may be chain-smokers. And some, you know, some of the
greatest authors of the last century. They all committed suicide in the end.
Because of frustration. So, because of, whatever situation was given. Basically,
they did not have much self-mastery. So, they did not have good qualities. So,
now, we may say that, ju..., isn't there scientific knowledge itself? Their
capacity to develop scientific, to do scientific research. Or their capacity, to
do, develop philosophical insight? You know. Isn't that itself, you know, a sign
of good quality? Not exactly. You know. He, actually, we get the capacity to do
intellectual processing by our past karma. So, some people are very good singers
by their past karma. Some people may be very good, you know, humorous by their
past karma. Some people may be very good intellectuals by their past karma. So,
you know, the, our, the con..., the abilities that we get, are largely developed
by our past karma. But how we uti..., but as far as our qualities are concerned,
you know, the qualities, do they come by past karma? Certain tendencies may
come. But our qualities are often result of our choices. And, you know, the
point here is that, material things do not lead to auspicious qualities. So,
material education does not lead necessarily to auspicious qualities. We will
talk about this more, you know, in the next part. So, now, Srila Prabhupada
talks about happiness in Krishna Consciousness. So, you know, you know, he,
here, he is talking about, you know, the, how, the, now, what is this point
about happiness in Krishna Consciousness as Srila Prabhupada is mentioning? He
talks about there are, "Rūpa Gosvāmī" now says three kinds of happiness.

"(1) happiness derived from material enjoyment, (2) happiness derived by
identifying oneself with the Supreme Brahman and (3) happiness derived from
Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

So, we could call it, you know, this is material happiness. This is impersonal
happiness. And this is, you know, devotional happiness. You know. So, now,
Prabhupada gives, quotes from several places. For example, he goes and quotes
"Satī". He goes, quote "Lord Śiva", to "Satī", in the "tantra-śāstra"s. He, you
know, you know, a devotee gets all other happiness, you know, happiness from the
material..., impersonalist. And he gets further happiness, also, more happiness
than that, also. So, let us look at this point more, now. When we talk about
happiness, Prabhupada explains analytically that the happiness that derived from
devotional service is the best because it is eternal. Whereas other happiness,
all other forms of happiness are temporary. And the happiness of devotional
service includes and excels the pleasures found in other types of happiness. You
know. So, what does this mean? This is, firstly, there is in terms of duration.
The other is in terms of quantity. In terms of duration, all other pleasures are
temporary. For purpose, and attain some very great fame. Or position in this
world. That person gets some plesure by that. But that is temporary. You know.
Person goes to heaven. Also, that is temporary. Person attains Brahma, ananda,
also. Brahmananda, also, does not satisfy the heart. You know. And, you know,
and, now, oth..., the other happi..., the other aspect is that the happiness
that we get by devotional service is, it, it is supreme happiness. So, if a
