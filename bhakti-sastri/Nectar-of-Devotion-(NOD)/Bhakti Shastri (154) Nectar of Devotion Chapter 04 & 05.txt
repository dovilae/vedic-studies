Hare Krishna. Welcome back to the Bhagavad, to the Bhakti Shastri course. In the
"Nectar of Devotion". In the previous class, we disussed about the eligibility
of devotional service. We discussed "kanistha". "madhyama". And "uttama". And
now, we move forward. So, before we move forward, we would like to discuss one
topic related with eligibility. That the important point in the process of
bhakti is recognising that we have a particular "adhikāra" based on our taste.
Our attraction towards Krishna. And attraction towards Krishna is not just
something sentimental. That, oh, how much do I speak about the esoteric pastimes
of Krishna? You know. How much am I always in, you know, you know, Vri..., the
mood of Vrindavan? That is all good. But actually, we see there were many
disciples of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur. Who were living in
Vrindavan. But, or in Mayapur. And they did not fulfill the instruction of
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur. They did not venture out from the holy dham to
travel all over the world to share Krishna Consciousness. You know. It was Srila
Prabhupada who took that mandate. It was Srila Prabhupada who had faith that
Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's prophecy will come through. And not just will come
through. Sri Chait..., Srila Prabhupada took it as his responsibility to make
that prophecy come through. So, you know, the advancement, the, when we talk
about taste, the, the taste is not just something superficial. The taste is not
just, oh, I, I think about esoteric pastimes of Krishna. Kind of pastimes which
nobody has heard. And that taste is a sign of advancement. Actually. The, when
we talk about taste, you know, it is taste to serve and please Krishna. You
know. And speaking Krishna Katha in a way that will please Krishna. You know.
If, you know, if we speak advanced pastimes of Krishna, and the, all that we think
about conju..., intimate conjugal pastimes of Radha and Krishna, and then that
increases material desires in the people. Then, is that really helping those
souls come to close to Krishna. Will that really be pleasing to Krishna? What
Srila Prabhupada did, it was, he spoke the necessary message. When Srila
Prabhupada said, my purports are my devotional ecstasies. What did he mean? You
know. A devotee's ecstasy is not self-centered. It is Krishna-centered. That
means that which gives Krishna ecstasy, a devotee, for that devotee, Krishna,
you know, that, for that, that is the source of a devotee's ecstasy. So, what
will give Krishna ecstasy is when the souls, who are far away from Him, come
close to Him. So, whatever obstacles are there. Whatever misconceptions are
there, if we remove those misconceptions, then that will enable the souls to
come closer to Krishna. So, the, when we talk about who is an advanced stage.
Who is a "madhyama-adhikāri"? Who is an "uttama-adhikāri"? You know. That should
be based on how much that person has comitted to the service of Krishna. And
Srila Prabhupada had that kind of extraordinary, unparalleled commitment. And
that is how in an old age, he was ready to travel all over the world. You know.
Sharing Krishna Consciousness with the peop..., people. And then, you know,
Srila Prabhupada's followers, within ISKCON, are also doing the same thing. In
their own, according to their own capacity. According to their "adhikāra". So,
sometimes, you know, some people, they say, oh, in ISKCON, you do not talk about
advanced Gaudiya-tattva. Oh, you do not talk about rasa-tattva. You do not talk
about raganuga-bhakti. You do not talk about this. You do not talk about that.
And they try to min..., in, denigrate. Or minimise. No. The important point is
to recognise that what is appropriate for people that is talked about. And as
devotees advanced, you know, as devotees advance, you know, they will naturally,
you know, understand what they need for their nourishment. And they will seek
that. Prematurely jumping to advanced, you know, s..., topics is not necessarily
a sign of advancement. Most often, it is not a sign of advancement. Often, it is
a sign of, actually, arrogance. That one thinks that one is qualified. When one
is not qualified. At one time, the devotees in ISKCON, you know, some of the
devotee leaders, they formed a group. And they started focusing on the esoteric
pastimes of Krishna. And they called themselves as the "Gopi Bhava Club". 04:41
