        sarathyam arjunasyadau, kurvan gitamrtam dadau 
        loka-trayopakaraya, tasmai krsnatmane namah

Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are
in Ninth Chapter. We discussed the two extremes in the previous verse. Those who
misunderstand Krishna. The mayavadis. "avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā". And "moghāśā
mogha-karmāṇo". 9.11 and 9.12. And those who understand Krishna properly. And
surrender to Him with love. That is "mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha". And, you know,
"satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ". Now, in-between these two, there is a spectrum of
other people. And Krishna will talk about them in 9.15. And elaborate about them
in the subsequent verses. So, let us look at 9.15:

        jñāna-yajñena cāpy anye
        yajanto mām upāsate
        ekatvena pṛthaktvena
        bahudhā viśvato-mukham

So, Krishna is telling here, you know, others who worship Him through knowledge.
"jñāna-yajñena cāpy anye". Others worship Him through "jñāna-yajñena". "yajanto
mām upāsate". So, Krishna is acknowledging that they worship Him. You know. You
know. And how do they do it? "ekatvena". "ekatvena" means through oneness.
"pṛthaktvena bahudhā". That the Supreme Lord manifests in many forms. And then,
"bahudhā viśv...". And then, "viśvato-mukham". "viśvato-mukham" is as the
universal form. You know. You know. So, now, actually, this verse will be a seed
for a lot of discussion. So, "pṛth...". You know. You know. What are these three
referring to? The "ekatvena" refers to the, you know, tho..., those who have the
conception of oneness. And they are here, Krishna is referring to them as b...,
b..., what is referring to is brahmavadis. The mayavadis already have been
talked about in, you know, 9.11 and 12. So, this will be addressed briefly by
Krishna. And Prabhupada will address it in the purport. And this "ekatvena" will
be elaborated again in the Twelfth Chapter. You know. When Arjuna asks the
questions amongst the pers..., personalists and impersonalists, who are better?
And then, "pṛthaktvena bahudhā", that refers to those who worship the devatas.
You know. You know. And, you know, the, of course, there can be demigod worship
with different conceptions. And we will discuss that. But that concept of
"pṛth...". "pṛthaktvena bahudhā" means that there are many. "pṛthak" is
different. And "bahudhā" is many. That there are many manifestations of the
divine. And we can worship different manifestations. That conception when people
have, that Krishna will elaborate in this chapter itself starting from verse 20
onwards till verse 28. Where He will contrast demigod worship with pure
devotional service. And then, "viśvato-mukham". "viśvato-mukham" refers to,
h..., the idea of the "viśva" being the "mukham" un..., the rupa, the Lord. That
there is a universal form. So, that will be mentioned briefly from verses 16 to
19 in this ver..., chapter. And then, later on, it will be elaborated again in
the Eleventh Chapter. And just prior to this, in 13-14 verses, what Krishna had
talked about pure devotional service. Krishna will talk about this towards the
end of this chapter. 9.29 to 34. And then, He will talk in the Tenth Chapter,
also. Till 10.11. After which, Arjuna will ask a question about Vibhuti Yoga.
And Krishna will answer that question. You know. So, this is an overview of, to
this verse is central to understanding the subsequent flow of the Gita. So,
here, "pṛthaktvena bahudhā" is elaborated immediately after that in the next
section of this chapter. "viśvato-mukham" is elaborated in this next section.
The "pṛthaktvena bahudhā" is elaborated in the section after the nex...,
immediate section. So, 16 to 19 will elaborate "viśvato-mukham". 20 to 28 will
elaborate on "pṛthaktvena bahudhā". You know. First, universal form is talked
about. Then, the, Kri..., you know, Kri..., demigod worship is talked about. And
then, this same "viśvato-mukham" will be talked about again in Ele..., Eleventh
Chapter. And "ekatvena" will be talked about in the Twelfth Chapter. So, what
are these three conceptions? See, when people want to be God conscious. You
know. It is not that suddenly, they start thinking about God. Their conceptions
evolve gradually. So, here, what are the three conceptions? So, one may think of
a, a round. I see this universe. It is so great. When I think about this
universe as so great. Then, I may start thinking that. Oh. Oh. Oh. That this
universe itself is sacred. It is using, universe itself is divine. And this can
be a form of pantheism. Pantheism means the idea that everything is God. So, one
may start worshiping the universe itself as God. And one may visualise different
aspects of the universe as, you know, as parts of that Absolute Truth.

So, here, the concept is that bigness is associated with greatness. And
greatness is associated with God. That which is, so, God is the greatest. So,
therefore, He must be the biggest. And the biggest thing that we see in the
world is the universe. So, you know, therefore, you know, the Sun and the moon
are the eyes, are my, are the eyes of Absolute Truth. The mountains are the
bones of the Absolute Truth. These sort of conceptions are talked about. And
that is what the meditation is. And of course, there are certain sacrifices,
also, which are performed in Vishvarupa upasana. That we will discuss in next
part. You know. You know. Next few verses. But the point here is that in the
vastness and the pervasiveness of the universe, one conceives of the Absolute
Truth. Then, "pṛthaktvena bahudhā" is the idea that, yes, ok, this universe is
vast and m..., m..., m..., huge, and sacred. In one sense. But beyond, but, you
know, ultimately, the universe is temporary. So, one's consciousness evolves
further. And one thinks that, actually, beyond this, there is some reality. And,
you know, you know, you know, or rather, beyond this, there are some, you know,
beings that are manifested. So, you know, who are controlling the various
aspects of the universe. So, "pṛthaktvena bahudhā" refers to, yes, there is
some ultimate reality. And that ultimate reality is manifesting, you know, as
the, you know, you know, various controllers. Now, how it is manifesting as a
various controllers, that may not be clear. But one sees a rain. And one think
there must be a controller for the rains. One think the Sun. You know. One
thinks about the Sun. And one thinks there must be a controller for the Sun. So,
in this way, one starts thinking that there are w..., so many awe-inspiring
features in nature. And they must require some, you know, controllers. And, you
know, is, and one is not very clear. But one think this, they must also be
having some connection with the Absolute Truth. This is how one comes to the
concept of polytheism. So, from pon..., pantheism to polytheism. Pantheism is
the idea that everything is God. Polytheism is that there are many Gods. So,
"pṛthaktvena bahudhā". And then, after that, one starts thinking that, actually,
you know, everything in the material world is temporary. There must be some, you
know, reality which is ultimately eternal. And, you know, and one starts
thinking, I also have a longing for eternity. And one thinks beyond the changes
of this world. There must be some sub..., cha..., unchanging substratum. And I
and that unchanging substratum are the same. That is how one concep..., con...,
comes to the conception of spiritual oneness. And that is "ekatvena". So, you
know, "bahudhā viśvato-mukham". You know. "viśvato-mukham" is the idea that
nature itsel..., you know, that the universal form is a mani..., is, you know,
to be worshipped. Then, the idea is that the various manifestations of the
controll..., various manifestations of the Absolute Truth as the controllers,
you know, the universal controllers have to be worshipped. And after that, you
know, the idea, beyond this, is spiritual reality. And I am, you know, you know,
one with that spiritual reality. So, "ekatvena". One worships them. Now,
Visvanatha Chakravarti Thakura explains that this hierarchy progresses from
downwards to upwards. That means "viśvato-mukham" is the lowest. Then,
"pṛthaktvena bahudhā" is intermediate. And "ekatvena" is highest. Why? Because
the conception is moving from material towards s..., spiritual. First, one is
basically thinking of material bigness in terms of size. You know. After that,
one is thinking of the controllers. One is thinking about consciousness. And
then, after that, one is thinking about the spiritual consicousness, the
maya..., I, in the form of oneness that lies beyond and below matter. Not below.
Below in terms of underlying matter. Unifying matter. Controlling matter. So, in
that sense, there is, this is the evolution of thought.

Now, Srila Prabhupada explains it oppositely. And we will look at this. You
know. You know. So, when, now, let us understand this once again. Vishvarupa
upasana, when it happens, this is re..., this is "viśvato-mukham". So, in
Vishvarupa upasana, what happens? The Vishvarupa, the aspects of the universal
form are used as material, meditation tools to reach the Absolute Truth. So,
one conceives the Absolute Truth in terms of, you know, the bigness of the
universe. We will discuss about Vishvarupa a little later. Then, then, "pṛthak",
now, this "pṛthaktvena bahudhā", the various manifestations. Now, different
people can do it in different way. But one particular way might be as Pratika
upasana. Pratika upasana. That means that one considers the demigods as symbols
of Brahman. So, one thi..., as pratika. As representative. As symbols of
Brahman. And worships the demigods accordingly. And "ekatvena". What is
mentioned over here is, that is Ahangropasana. Ahangropasana is, you know, one
worships oneself. Thinking of oneself as the Absolute Truth. Now, those who are
like this. Those who are Ahangropasanas are not mayavadis. Because they do not
offend the Krishna's form. That is something very important to understand. That
these Ahangropasanas, they, you know, may conceive of themselves as one with the
Absolute Truth. But conceiving of oneself as one with the Absolute Truth is in
and of itself not mayavada. And it is not necessarily always offensive. What
makes mayavada offensive is the notion that Krishna's form is material.
Krishna's form is illusory. Krishna's form is false. And that one has to go
beyond Krishna's form. That notion is what is offensive. And that is the notion
that one needs to go beyond. Or one needs to give up. You know. The idea that
one has to go beyond Krishna's form to some higher reality is offensive
conception. So, you know, these are the Ahangropasanas. And then, beyond that,
after that, there is another, you know, you know, way of looking at this
which Srila Prabhupada uses. So, I will explain the hierarchy now, of these
three. You know. So, from the philosophical perspective, you know, you know, ok,
so, to explain these different perspectives, let us look at it from the
perspective of philosophical perspective. You know. You know. The mayavadis can
be said to be better than the karmis. Why is that? Because the karmis are
engaged in sense gratification. But the mayavadis are detached from sense
gratification. So, if you know, con..., if we consider from the perspective of
the level of philosophical insight. The mayavadis have understood to some extent
that this material world cannot provide happiness. So, they have, we could say,
in one way, a greater philosophical insight. So, many of the mayavadis may be
renunciates. They may learn, be learnt in the scripture. And they are pursuing
the Absolute Truth. So, from the philosophical perspective, they may, they may
be philosophically more, you know, sophisticated. Philosophically more
insightful than the karmis. So, in that sense, you know, with mayavadis may,
also, some of the mayavadis may also live life in goodness. So, when they lead
life in goodness. Even they lead live in goodness. Then, you know, karmis will
be living life in passion, also. So, in that sense, from that perspective, we
could say the mayavadis are sligh..., more evolved. But then, this is the one
perspective. But the other perspective is the devotional perspective. That the
devotional perspective is, one's position is not determined so much by where one
is. But by what one's attitude towards Krishna is. So, that means, if one is
blasphemous of Krishna. One is offensive towards Krishna. Then, in that sense,
the mayav.., the, actually, the, you know, k..., karmis may become better than
the mayavadis. Why? Because the karmis have a greater chance of coming closer to
Krishna. Because they are not offensive towards Krishna.

The mayavadis, you know, have a greater chance of coming closer towards Krishna.
Because they have, they do not have such a great, good chance because they are
offensive to Krishna. In fact, what they think is they cannot come to, closer to
Krishna because their goal is to go beyond Krishna. So, because of their
offensiveness, for them to make devotional advancement is generally difficult.
That is why we have to understand, you know, consider these two different
perspectives. So, same way, when we consider these two different perspectives.
What Srila Prabhupada explains is that the Ahangropasana, so these three, these
three hiearchy level which, you know, which Chakravarti Pada has explained that
the Vishvarupa upasanas are the lower. Then, there is "e...", "pṛthaktvena
bahudhā". And there is Ahangropasana. So, this is with respect to, say,
philosophical understanding. That one understand that there is a spiritual
reality. And that spiritual reality should be worshipped. So, from the
conception of one's con..., capacity to conceive of the Absolute Truth in terms
of eternal existence. You know. And spiritual existence. The "ekatvena" is
higher. But then, if you turn it around. Look it from the devotional
perspective. And the conception of worship is most prominent in Vishvarupa
upasana. And least prominent in Ahangropasana. Why? Because if I am worshipping
myself, then actually, it is, you know, you know, it is a paradox of terms. It
is a sort of self-contradiction. What do you mean by that? I worship myself. If
I say, I am my own God. And I worship myself. It is not, it is quite an
antithesis of devotion. So, it is not very theistically evolved, or theis..., 
devotionally conducive conception. So, higher than that is the conception of
"pṛthaktvena bahudhā". Oh, there the, there, there is the devatas. An..., and
they should be worshipped. So, you know, but b..., higher than that is the
conception of there is one Absolute Truth. And that Absolute Truth is manifested
in the Vishvarupa. And I should worship that. So, the concept of worship, which
is conducive to devotion is most prominent in Vishvarupa upasana. And least
prominent in Ahangropasana. And that is why from that perspective, when Srila
Prabhupada explains this hierarchy, he focuses on the devotional perspective
throughout his purports. Because devotional service is the ultimate conclusion
of the Bhagavad Gita as we will see in its progression. It is especially clear
in 18.66.

        sarva-dharmān parityajya
        mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja

So, here, by focusing on the devotional perspective, you know, where worship is
critically important. And for that, the conception of, you know, the difference
between worship and worship w..., are important. So, Ahangropasana is the
lowest. And then, you know, there is Vishvarupa upasana. And then, you know,
there is "pṛthaktvena", there is Vishvarupa upasana. So, let us look at Srila
Prabhupada's purport which explains things from this perspective. So, Prabhupada
explains here that, you know, you know:

"Out of the above three, the lowest, those who worship themselves as the Supreme
Lord, thinking themselves to be monists, are most predominant."

So, these are widespread conception today, also.

"Such people think themselves to be the Supreme Lord, and in this mentality they
worship themselves. This is also a type of God worship, for they can understand
that they are not the material body but are actually spiritual soul; at least,
such a sense is prominent."

So, here, what Srila Prabhupada is saying is that this is also a type of God
worship. So, it is important that that means Ahangropasana because it also
involves some kind of upasana. It involves another conception of eternal
existence. It involves the conception of worship. So, it is also a type of God
worship. So, you know, when this is clearly not referring to mayavadis. This is
referring to something different. And it is one type of brahmavada. So, now, let
us look at Vishvarupa upasana. Which is described from the next sec..., se...,
next set of verses. 16 verse onwards. Let us look at it. So, Krishna explains in
the next verses what He has talked about in 4.24, He will give more rela...,
bold understanding in 9.16. Let us look at it.

        ahaṁ kratur ahaṁ yajñaḥ
        svadhāham aham auṣadham
        mantro ’ham aham evājyam
        aham agnir ahaṁ hutam

So, "ahaṁ kratur ahaṁ yajñaḥ". You know. "ahaṁ kratur". So, here, actually,
Krishna is talking about the various elements of the sacrifice. He says, I am
the Vedic ritual. I am the "sva...", "yajñaḥ", so, "kratur" refers to the Vedic
ritual. "yajñaḥ" refers to the Puranic rituals. "smṛti" sacrifice. That means
there are sacrifices which are mentioned in different scriptures. And
accordingly, the scriptures, whatever the sacrifices are mentioned, they
sometimes are different technical names. So, you know, you know, you know, in a
general, non-technical sense, we can say "kratur" refers to sacrifice.
Specifically, "kratur" refers to sacrifice mentioned in the four Vedas. The
four Vedas. And "yajñaḥ" refers to sacrifice which men..., mentioned in "smṛti"
scriptures. Krishna is saying, I am both the sacrifices. "svadhāham". I am
what is offered in it. So, "auṣ...", oblation. Then, I am the healing herb. You
know.

        svadhāham aham auṣadham
        mantro ’ham ...

Whatever the mantra that are chanted, I am that mantra. "aham evājyam". So, when
the melted butter, the ghee is offered. That is also I am. "aham agnir ahaṁ
hutam". I am the fire. So, basically, you know, Krishna is helping us to see
that when we perform our fire sacrifice, it is not just some material elements
interacting. It is actually, ultimately a manifestation of the Absolute Truth.
Now, you know, we will see the evolution of thought in the Bhagavad Gita. In
4.24, what did happen was, all the elements of the sacrifice were identified
with Brahma. What was 4.24?

        brahmārpaṇaṁ brahma havir
        brahmāgnau brahmaṇā hutam
        brahmaiva tena gantavyaṁ
        brahma-karma-samādhinā

So, there, it is described that all the elements of the sacrifice are Brahma.
But here, what is described? That is accepted. But here, the thought is taken
further. And it is said that it is actually "ahaṁ". All of it, I am that. "ahaṁ
kratur ahaṁ yajñaḥ". I am all this. So, what is the point over, what is the
point over there? That when the nishkama-karma-yogi is performing sacrifices.
At that time, nishkama-karma-yogi does not know what is that Absolute Truth.
But, you know, as one moves forwards, one starts understanding what that
Absolute Truth is. So, here, when the person is a devotee, from the devotional
perspective, it is clear that the, ultimately, all the elements of the "yajñaḥ"
are manifestation of Bhagavan Sri Krishna. So, of Krishna, Himself. So, Krishna
makes it very clear here. "ahaṁ kratur ahaṁ yajñaḥ". So, what was mentioned
there, you know, you know, in terms of the seeker's level at that time as Brahma
is now clearly specified as "ahaṁ". This is how the, you know, sac..., you know,
the thought of the Bhagavad Gita is progressive. And it is revealed in the same
concepts in a more Krishna centered way. Now, Krishna explains how He pervades
all aspects of existence. So:

        pitāham asya jagato
        mātā dhātā pitāmahaḥ
        vedyaṁ pavitram oṁ-kāra
        ṛk sāma yajur eva ca

So, "pitāham asya jagato". That I am the father of this whole universe. Of all
living beings within this universe. And not only I am the father. "mātā dhātā
pitāmahaḥ". I am the mother. I am the sustainer. And I am the grandfather, also.
"vedyaṁ pavitram oṁ-kāra". So, "vedyaṁ". Ultimately, all the object of knowledge
that we have, it is ultimately He. "vedyaṁ". "pavitram oṁ-kāra". So, I am the,
now, "oṁ-kāra". The sacred song. Syllable. And the purify, Prabhupada says that,
I am, here, I am "pavitram". So, whatever purifies us, that is also Krishna
only. And then, "ṛk sāma yajur eva ca". And I am also the Vedas. So, what is the
point over here? You know. What is the connection with what has been going on?
Actually, the point is, in Vishvarupa upasana, one starts conceiving of
everything in the universe. As ultimately, connected with and manifesting the
Absolute Truth. So, here, also, same point is made. "pitāham asya jagato". That
actually I am the father of all living beings. So, in this world, we have
different supports. Different inspirations. Different shelters. And Krishna is
saying, I am all of them. So, I am the father. I am the mother. I am the
grandsire. So, now, is this to be taken literally? You know. Sometimes, people
have this conception that, you know, when some devotees, you know, start
praticing spiritual life. And sometimes, their parents oppose. So, when their
parents oppose, then, the parents say, you should obey us. "matru devo bo pitru
devo bo". So, you know, you know, I, is Krishna supporting something similar
over here? That the mother is God? Father is God? Yes. The mother and father are
God. But in what sense? You know. Is that statement "matru devo bo pitru devo
bo" a literal statement? If it were that the mother and father are God. Then,
we would have two Gods. Not one God. And then, if the mother wants the son to
become a doctor. And the father wants the son to become an engineer. So, which
God is the son to follow? The mother God or the father God? You know. If the
moth..., mother and father have a conflict. You know. Whose side is the son
supposed to take? Do Gods have conflicts among themselves? So, the point is not
to disrespect the parents, obviously. The point is recognise sta..., statements
in their context. The context is that, actually, the mother and the father are
manifestations of the Absolute Truth. They mani..., they, you know, in this
world, there are many things which sustain us. Which help us. Which help us.
Which, you know, assist us in our onward journey. Materially as well as
spiritually. You know. You know. So, whoever is, help, does in any way, we are
grateful for that. But at the same time, we also recognise that there is
something which is to be, you know, the ultimate reality. So, we are grateful to
our parents. But here, the point that Krishna is making is that ultimately
whoever are the shelters in this world, whatever is benefiting us, it is
ultimately a manifestation of Him. It is who, He who is benefiting us through
those things. So, it is He who is, you know, giving us shelter. So, it is
Krishna who is giving us His love through these things. It is Krishna who is
giving us shelter and strength through the mother. Through the father. Through
the grandfather. It is He who is the, giving us knowledge. It is He who is
purifying us. It is who has given us the Vedas. So, in the sense that ultimately
everything is coming from Him. Everything gets its potency from Him. This verse
is to be understood. And we will see this concept repeated again in the
Fif..., Tenth Chapter in terms of "vibhuti". At that time, also, we will discuss
it further. So, here, when Krishna is talking about this particular, you know,
spiritual vision of the Vedic "yajñaḥ" sacrifices. The focus is on seeing
everything as connected with Him. So, here, now, Srila Prabhupada's purport, you
know, you know, you know, you know, you know, seems to, might seem a little
confusing. So, Prabhupada says:

"these living entities who appear to be our father, mother, etc., are nothing
but Kṛṣṇa."

So, then, Prabhupada says further:

"Not only are our father and mother parts and parcels of Kṛṣṇa, but the creator,
grandmother and grandfather, etc., are also Kṛṣṇa. Actually any living entity,
being part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, is Kṛṣṇa."

So, the point is, that Prabhupada is emphasising the point, he talk..., you
know, emphasising the philosophical principle of "Achintya-Bheda-Abheda". The
part, you know, is non-different from the whole. Because the part also is a
manifestation of the whole. And part contains, you know, part is qualitatively
similar to the whole. So, in that sense, every living entity is also Krishna.
So, after describing this, you know, you know, you know, and then, you know, you
know, Krishna will move forward. And describe how the, again, He emphasising
the same principle in next verse. That whatever gives us shelter is ultimately
He only.

        gatir bhartā prabhuḥ sākṣī
        nivāsaḥ śaraṇaṁ suhṛt
        prabhavaḥ pralayaḥ sthānaṁ
        nidhānaṁ bījam avyayam

So, here, He explains. "gatir bhartā". "gatir" is the, He is the ultimate
destination. He is "bhartā". He is the maintainer. You know. And then,
"prabhuḥ". He is the Lord. He is the master. "sākṣī". He is the indwelling
witness. He is, He knows everything that we are doing. "nivāsaḥ". He is the
shelter. There, ultimately, we are all desiring "śaraṇaṁ". He is ultimate object
of refuge and surrender for us. "suhṛt". He is our greatest friend. "prabhavaḥ
pralayaḥ sthānaṁ". That, you know, you know, you know, actually, when creation
takes place, it unfolds from Him. When dissolution takes places, "pralayaḥ
sthānaṁ". Where addressed, now, that is "sthānaṁ". Ultimately He only. "nidhānaṁ
bījam avyayam". He is the resting place of everything. And "bījam avyayam".
"bījam avyayam" refers to, He is the imperishable seed. Krishna has talked about
the concept of "bījam avyayam" earlier, also. In the, you know, you know,
Seventh Chapter when He talked about how He is the essence of everything.

        bījaṁ māṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
        viddhi pārtha sanātanam

So, you know, you know, you know, "bījaṁ", "sanātanam". We discussed the concept
of imperishable seed. Normally, when a seed, you know, you know, gives a rise to
a tree, the seed no longer exists. But Krishna is such that, you know, from Him,
so many living entities come. From Mahavishnu, so many universes come. But
Krishna remains as He is. Krishna never gets depleted. So, "bījam avyayam". You
know. You know. Now, from Him, we can say, from father, also, many sons can
come. But that, you know, but that does not mean the father does not get
depleted. You know. Father is going to grow old. Get diseased. And eventually
succumb, you now, to time. So, but Krishna is "avyayam". So, this is actually a
verse which, you know, very wonderfully explains what is God. How does it
explain what is God? These are re..., in, we can have a definition of God in
terms of He is the generator. Organiser. Destroyer. He is the source of
everything. He is the Absolute Truth. Yeah. But in terms of relationship with
us and the things around us. This is very beautiful my, verse to meditate on the
Absolute Truth. "gatir bhartā prabhuḥ sākṣī". You know. In this world, so many
different people give us love. They may give us kind..., you know, the, ch...,
kindness to us. They may grant us shelter. As devotees, we feel grateful to
whoever helps us. And at the same time, we also recognise that it is Krishna who
is helping us through them. When Srila Prabhupada, you know, you know, was on
the Jaladuta, you know, going to, you know, America. At that time, he went into
diary. And the extracts of the diary, you know, are there in "līlāmrta".
And the diary has also been published as a separate book. So, there, Prabhupada
mentions that, you know, he, he, he writing in his diary on the early days of
