Hare Krishna. Welcome back to the Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are
now in the Twelfth Chapter of the Bhagavad Gita discussing bhakti yoga. In that,
we have dis..., discussed the first section how, you know, worship of the
personal aspect of the Absolute Truth is preferable to worship of the impersonal
aspect. Let us look at the overview here, quickly. You know. So, one, verses 1
to 7 talked about how worship of personal form, you know, is higher than the
worship of the impersonal Brahman. And then, verses 8 to 12 talk about the
progressive stages of bhakti. That is what we were discussing. We discussed 8
and 9. Now, we will discuss the Tenth one. And after this, next section will be
qualities that endear one to Krishna. So, in this way, this chapter basically
talks about first, ba..., you know, first, ok, how bhakti is the best process
for transcendence. Then, how bhakti can be practiced at multiple levels. And how
one can cultivate the qualities that will make one into a devotee. So,
ultimately, who is a devotee? A devotee is not, the one who loves Krishna. And
one whom Krishna loves. So, these qualities help us to endear ourselves to
Krishna. That means we become better devotees by that. So, in this way, the
chapter talks about bhakti yoga in different, three different ways. Let us look
at, you know, eight, you know, 12.10.

        abhyāse ’py asamartho ’si
        mat-karma-paramo bhava
        mad-artham api karmāṇi
        kurvan siddhim avāpsyasi

So, "abhyāse ’py asamartho ’si". "asamarthaḥ" means, you know, incapable.
"abhyāse" was what I was talked about in the previous verse.

        abhyāsa-yogena tato
        mām icchāptuṁ dhanañ-jaya

So, by the practice of "abhyāsa-yoga", obtain the desire to attain Me. So,
"abhyāse ’py asamartho ’si". That if you are incapable of doing "abhyāse". Then,
"mat-karma-paramo bhava". That make My karma the supreme goal. Become dedicated
to working for Me. "paramo" can become supreme. "paramo" can also mean
"mat-paraḥ". Fix the mind on Me. Make Me your ultimate aspiration.
"mat-karma-paramo bhava". So, there is a difference between "mat-paramaḥ" and
"mat-karma-paramaḥ". So, "mat-para" means our heart, our soul, you know, our
mind, our intelligence, our whole inner being is offered to Krishna. That is
"mat...". So, "mat-para" is in, in, you know, is a higher level than
"mat-karma-paramo". So, "mat-karma-paramo" means we are doing various works. But
we understand the work that I do for Krishna is the most important. And work for
Him. So, what I try to do is, I do work for Krishna. And I try to make all my
work internal offering to Krishna. And then, what will happen by this?
"mad-artham api karmāṇi". If you in this way work for Me, "kurvan siddhim
avāpsyasi". "siddhim avāpsyasi". You will attain perfection by this, also. So,
Krishna is, you know, taking the level s..., lower. Lower. Lower. And He is
telling that, ok, just like, you know, if a person is, you know, trapped at the
bottom of a well. And somebody, you know, sends down a rope. And this person
says, ok, you stretch your hands up. And then, you stand on your toes. And pull
up. And then, I can catch the rope. That person says I cannot do that. And then,
that person brings a rope further down. Ok. Now, you just raise your hands. A
little bit up. You can catch the rope. Then, when that person cannot do that,
also. Then, the rope comes further down. And then, the person says, ok. Now, the
rope is right around your waist. All that you have to, just tie around your
waist. I will pull you out. So, it is like that. Krishna is extending down the
mercy lower and lower. And He is saying over here. "mad-artham api karmāṇi". If
you work for Me in this way. "kurvan siddhim avāpsyasi". "siddhim", you will
attain. What is "siddhim"? You know. That "siddhim" is, the word "siddhim"
literally means perfection. So, Krishna has used the word "siddhim" several
times in the Bhagavad Gita. You know. The most prominent use, which is relevant
over here is. 

        manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
        kaścid yatati siddhaye
        yatatām api siddhānāṁ
        kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ

So, Kri..., "yatati siddhaye". Very few people attain, attai..., endeavor for
perfection. In 7.3, Krishna says. And out of those, out of, you know, you know,
thousands, few endeavor for perfection. And out of the, out of those who
endeavor for perfection, even fewer actually achieve perfection. So, in this
way, what Krishna is telling over there is, He uses the word perfection to rfeer
to the quest for transcendence. So, you know, you know, sometimes, the word
"siddhim" is also used for yogic perfections. Or mystic perfections. You know.
There, there is "Anima Siddhi". There is "Laghima Siddhi". And that is with
respect, these are material perfections. But this whole chapter is a bhakti yoga
chapter. And that is why the yogic or mystic "siddhis" are not being talked
about over here. Here, Krishna is talking about the devotional perfections. And
those devotional perfections ultimately culminate in pure love for Krishna.
Krishna is saying that, even by working for Me, you will ultimately come to the
level of attaining Me. So, now, when we look at this, "mat-karma-paramo bhava".
Work for Me. Let us try to understand this now. So, in working for Krishna,
there can, you know, you know, be two sublevels. You know. Work for Krishna. One
can be the direct, do His work. That is render service to Him. And then,
indirect can be offer him the fruits of our work. Now, what is the difference
between the two? Do His work means, for example, say, during the marath..., book
distribution marathon, we may go out and distribute books. Or we may ourselves
try to share Krishna's message. We may do some services in the temple. So, that
is do His work. So, it is Krishna's work. It is Krishna's mission. And we help
in Krishna's mission. That is do His work. And then, there is also indirect.
Offer Him the fruits of the work. So, how do we offer in the fruits of the work?
By offering Him the, you know, you know, part, part of the work that we are
doing. That means, say, we have our job. We have our profession. And we,
whatever we on, we give charity from that. And we try to spiritualise of the
work that we. So, "mat-karma-paramo", technically would mean do My work. But for
a devotee, even the family life, the family is, also, devotee tries to integrate
with the spiritual life. Devotee tries to work for Krishna. And integrate the
whole family into the, you know, devotional service of Krishna. The devotee
sees that, my family members, if they are devotees, that is wonderful. But even
if they are not devotees, still, they are also parts of Krishna. And it is
ultimately by Krishna's arrangement that I am placed in the situation amidst
these family members. And let me try to, you know, you know, serve Krishna, you
know, by taking care of them materially and spiritually. So, in this way, this
is what, you know, "mat-karma-paramo bhava". So, Prabhupada writes in the
purport that, he talks about this principle of material engagement. That:

"Every endeavor requires land, capital, organization and labor."

So, there is human resources. There is financial resources. There is
infrastructural resources. And then, there is, you know, organisational
resources. So, these are the four resources. Human resources is labor.
Infrastructural resources will be land. And then, financial resources will be
capital. And then, there is infrastruct..., and then, there is organisational.
You know. Everything that we have, we have to organise it properly. So, you
know, you know, say, a person wants to construct a, you know, construct, a
builder wants to construct a buinder..., building. So, then, the per..., there
is capital required for that, you know, not only. There is, first of all, land
is required for anything. So, we need the land on which we will be constructing
the building. Along with that, capital is needed to purchase all the materials
for constructing the building. Capital is needed for higher labor, also. Who
will be actually do the building. And then, there is organisation required. Now,
there has to be some specially trained people who will manage and oversee the
project. And they will make sure that everything is going according to plan. So,
these are required. You know. You know. Finances. Land. Mar..., you know,
fin..., capital. Organisation. And labor. So, Prabhupada is saying all these are
included in "mat-karma-paramo bhava". So, when, so, whatever is, these possible,
one can work for Krishna. So, Prabhupada writes:

"The only difference is that in materialism one works for sense gratification.
The same work, however, can be performed for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, and that
is spiritual activity."

So, when we perform for the satisfaction of Krishna, that becomes spiritual
activity. You know. You know. You know. Prabhupada talks about, how, you know,
publication can also be done. You know. This vol..., what, now, how does this
raise one to Krishna?

"This voluntary service to the cause of Kṛṣṇa consciousness will help one to
rise to a higher state of love for God, whereupon one becomes perfect."

So, "voluntary service to the cause of Kṛṣṇa consciousness". You know. What,
whatever we are doing, we could do it for other purposes. But we are doing it
for Krishna. It is a voluntary service. And when we do this voluntary service
for the sake of Krishna, for the cause of Krishna Consciousness, by that, we
make spiritual advancement. Now, after this, Krishna goes one level downwards.
An then, He says, if you cannot, if somebody cannot do that, also. Somebody
cannot work for Krishna, also. Then, we may, may think, oh, such a person who
cannot work for Krishna, get out. You are going to be a materialist. You are
going to be a sinful person. You are going to go to hell. No. Krishna does not
exhibit such an attitude. Krishna accommodates even those who, you know, you
could say fo..., do not accommodate Him. You know. This is Krishna's, you know,
great love that He accommodates even those who do not accommodate Him. See,
Krishna is Himself already so accommodating. He says, first, you offer your
heart to Me. Or at least, then try to think about Me. If you cannot do that,
work for Me. Now, somebody says, what more can Krishna do? If, if you do not
want to do even this much for me, then I will reject you. Krishna says no.
Krishna is such a loving God that, you know, you know, He accommodates even
those who refuse to accommodate Him. So, how does He do that? He, by encouraging
them towards a general spirit of sacrifice. Let us look at this verse. 12.11.

        athaitad apy aśakto ’si
        kartuṁ mad-yogam āśritaḥ
        sarva-karma-phala-tyāgaṁ
        tataḥ kuru yatātmavān

So, "athaitad apy aśakto ’si". "athaitad". "aitad" means, what was described in
the previous verse. "aśakto ’si". If one is not able to do even that. "kartuṁ
mad-yogam āśritaḥ". So, "mad-yogam āśritaḥ". You know. That means what?
"mat-karma-paramo bhava". Working for Me. Even, that means, that level of
connection with Krishna by working for Him, if one cannot do even that. Then,
what should do, one do? "sarva-karma-phala-tyāgaṁ". That give up all the work.
"sarva-karma-phala-tyāgaṁ". So, give up the fruits of all the work. You know.
Give, give up the, basically the fruits of work. "tataḥ kuru yatātmavān". So,
"ātma-vān". Be self-situated. Now, this is a beautiful word. "ātma-vān". Krishna
has used this word "ātma-vān" earlier, also, in the Bhagavad Gita. Especially in
2.45.

        trai-guṇya-viṣayā vedā
        nistrai-guṇyo bhavārjuna
        nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho
        niryoga-kṣema ātmavān

So, "ātm...", there Krishna is saying that go beyond the three modes. And become
situated, you know, in the transcendence. And when you are situated in, in 
transcendence, be free from dualities. "nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho". Be in, be
in, you know, pure goodness. That is transcendence. And "niryoga-kṣema ātmavān".
Be free from, you know, you know, be free from the considerations of gain and
loss. By holding unto the atma. Now, the word "vān" means possessor. Just like
we have "dhanavan". That means one who is the possessor of wealth. Or bhagyavan.
One who is the possessor of fortune. So, like that, "dhanavan". So, like that,
"ātma-vān" means one who is the possessor of the soul. Now, we may, normally,
our idea is that the possessor, and the possessed or the possession are
different. You know. For example, you know, I may have this computer. So, I am
the possessor. And this is the possession. So, the normal understanding is that
the possession and the possessor have to be different. You know. So, then, if
the possession and the possessor have to be different. Then, if I am the atma,
then I am, I am the possessor. But if I have to become "ātma-vān", then I have
to become the possession. So, how can the same be the possessor as well as the
possession? You know. You know. How can the same be the owner and the owned? So,
this is the indicative of the link at the level of consciousness. That means if
a person may be an owner. Like some..., sometimes, when people get old. And
nowadays, very unhealthy, tragically, very heart-breaking, sometimes, people get
disease. Like Alzheimer's. And they just lose their memory completely. When they
lose their memory. Or not just memory, actually. They, they just lose their
capacity for rationale thinking. Capacity for recognising. Capacity for
appropriate and ad..., adequate emotional responses. So, at that time, the
person may be the owner of the house. But if the person has got Alzheimer's,
that person is not aware that I am the owner of the house. That person just does
not know anything at that time. So, like that, you know, we may be in possession
of something. But we may not know that we are in possession of that thing. Of
course, the other is also possib..., possible that we do not possess anything.
And we think we are the possessors. Actually, we do not own anything. You know.
Whatever we think is my house. And my home. My car. And all these things. 15:09
