    prapanna parijataya
    totra vetraika panaye
    jnana mudraya krishnaya
    gitamrita duhe namah

Hare Krishna. So, welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. Now,
we are starting with the Twelfth Chapter. Twelfth Chapter, as we know, is called
as bhakti yoga. Or "Devotional Service", Prabhupada translates it. Literally.
And this is the last chapter in the bhakti section. So, all the Eighteen
Chapters in the Bhagavad Gita talk about bhakti. But the first fity..., 6
Chapters have, focus on karma. And how karma leads to bhakti. The last Six
Chapters focus on jnana. And how jnana leads to bhakti. The middle Six Chapters
focus on bhakti itself. So, you know, Arjuna has, in the Tenth Chapter, accepted
Krishna's supremacy. And asked to see the, you know, you know, you know, Virata,
the vibhutis. The manifestations of Krishna's greatness in nature. Then, while
desc..., you know, while Arjuna desc...., Arju..., he is hearing that, Then,
Krishna makes a reference to how he is sustaining the whole world. You know. You
know. With just one fragment of His being. That he mentions in 10.42. In
response to that, Arjuna asks the question to sho..., be shown the "Virata
rupa". And that is shown in the Eleventh Chapter. Now, after seeing this
magnificent and awe-inspiring. And in some ways, scaring form of the Absolute
Truth. Arjuna has another question. What about the impersonal form? What about
the, now, we, now, the word, we could say impersonal form is a paradox. Because
fo..., form cannot be impersonal. Form is normally personal. So, we could say
the impersonal aspect of the Absolute Truth. You know. So, you know, you know,
you know, what about the impersonal aspect? Now, in, if we remember, in 9.15, it
was a, it was a critical verse that underlies th..., much of the flow of the
later chapters. So:

        jñāna-yajñena cāpy anye
        yajanto mām upāsate
        ekatvena pṛthaktvena
        bahudhā viśvato-mukham

So, "ekatvena". In oneness. "pṛthaktvena bahudhā". And, you know, through the
worship of the demigods. And "viśvato-mukham". So, these were three ways in
which people do "jñāna-yajñe". People worship Krishna through the ritual,
through sacrifice of knowledge. So, in that, "pṛthaktvena bahudhā". You know.
Through the worship of the demigods. That has been talked about in the, you
know, Ninth Chapter, itself. From verses 9.20 to 28. Where Krishna says that,
those who worship the demigods, they f..., you know, they have to continue on
cycle of birth and death. "gatāgataṁ kāma-kāmā labhante" is in 9.21. And
first, for that, devotees, "ananyāś cintayanto māṁ". He says, "yoga-kṣemaṁ
vahāmy aham". I protect them. So, the point which I am making is, three things
were talked about. And two of them have been dealt with. So, the first that was
talked about was demigod worship. That was dealt about in that chapter itself.
Then, "visva rupa upasana". "viśvato-mukham". That was talked about briefly in
that chapter itself. From verses 16 to 19. And then, it was talked about in the
Eleventh Chapter. Now, what remains is "ekatvena". "ekatvena". Oneness. So,
what does this refer to? What is this whole concept of worshipping of the
Absolute Truth in an impersonal manifestation? Thinking of oneself as one with
the Absolute Truth. That is what Arjuna will question now. So, in that sense,
the 12.1 is not immediately related with the 11.55. There is no linear,
chronological correlation with the, just the previous verse. But it is an
exploration of, you know, discussion that had started earlier. So, what was
mentioned in 4.15, that is now being, you know, you know, explicated by Krishna.
And, you know, Arjuna is being inspired by Krishna from within to ask questions
which will lead to the further se..., you know, further exploration all the
relevant topics. So, the Twelfth Chapter starts with a question by Arjuna. Let
us quickly look at the flow of the Twelfth Chapter. You know. You know. So, you
know, 1 to 7, in this ta..., ta..., seven, twelfth, establish how worship of the
personal form is superior to worship of the impersonal Brahman. Then, 8 to 12
talk about the progressive stages of bhakti. And after that, 13 to 20 talk about
qualities that endear one to Krishna. Qualities that endear one. Because of
which, you know, we feel, you know, because of which, Krish..., you know,
Kri..., these qualities, Krishna likes in His devotees. So, let us look at these
one by one. Let us start with 12.1:

        arjuna uvāca

        evaṁ satata-yuktā ye
        bhaktās tvāṁ paryupāsate
        ye cāpy akṣaram avyaktaṁ
        teṣāṁ ke yoga-vittamāḥ

So, you know, you know, you know, "evaṁ satata-yuktā ye". Those who are
constantly engaged. "bhaktās tvāṁ paryupāsate". With bhakti, "tvāṁ paryupāsate".
They worship You. "ye cāpy akṣaram avyaktaṁ". In contrast, those who "akṣaram".
And "avyaktaṁ". That which is beyond the senses. That which is unmanifested. You
know. "teṣāṁ ke". Among those who are "yoga-vittamāḥ". "vittamāḥ". So, "tamāḥ",
as we know, is superlative. It is the best. So, who are the most perfect in
"yoga"? This is an interesting question. In the sense that both are on the
transcendental path. Now, what is, you know, what are, how are these two
categories that are being referred to? Which Krishna is saying. Ok. Both seem to
be good. But who is better? Or who is the best? "tamāḥ" means best. So, you
know, you know, now, if we look at the words itself. "bhaktās tvāṁ paryupāsate".
So, it is very clearly referring to the devotional path. And the devotional
conception. "bhaktās" itself clearly dev..., devotion. And "tvāṁ", you know, is
also referring to You. Now, "evaṁ satata-yuktā ye". So, now, "satata-yuktā" is
also a very clear reference to something. Not just the meaning of it, you know,
wha..., you know, what it literally means. You know. But what, the way it has
been used earlier, also. Krishna has said in the, you know, Chatur Shloki
Bhagavad Gita.

        teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ
        bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam
        dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ
        yena mām upayānti te

So, in 10.10, He has used the same word. "satata-yuktā". As has been used over
here. So, "satata-yuktānāṁ". It was here "satata-yuktā". So, clearly, the first
part is referring to "bhaktās". And then, "ye cāpy akṣaram avyaktaṁ". You know.
You know. So, now, "akṣaram". And "avyaktaṁ". What does it refer to? Now, if we
look at it, the way Krishna has used the word "akṣaram". And "avyaktaṁ". In the
past. You know. The word, it, it basically means unmanifested. That which is not
perceivable. So, now, if that is to be considered to be a comparative object of
worship, then that will refer to the Absolute Truth. In terms of the impersonal
aspect. So, Arjuna is asking basically which form of worship is better.
Personal. Or impersonal. Which aspect of the Absolute Truth is better to
worship? You know. Or more precisely, you know, his question is which
worshippers are better situated? Which worshippers are more intimately united
with You? Those who are worshippers of the impersonal aspect? Or those who are
worshippers of the personal aspect? So, now, moving forward, let us look at
Krishna's reply. So, Krishna's reply focuses on, you know, you know,
establishing the personal aspect very explicitly. So, what Krishna does is He
focuses on using words which remove all ambiguity from the context. You know.
Sometimes, when in, a question is asked. Then, the answer is given. If the
que..., if the answer is not very clearly related with the verse, then the,
there can be multiple interpretations that are possible. But the way Krishna
u..., the way Krishna, you know, uses words over here, He makes things so un...,
unambiguous. That it is very, it becomes very easy to understand what He is
referring to. So, let us look at the next verse. You know. So:

        śrī-bhagavān uvāca

        mayy āveśya mano ye māṁ
        nitya-yuktā upāsate
        śraddhayā parayopetās
        te me yukta-tamā matāḥ

So, "mayy āveśya mano ye māṁ". "mayy āveśya". "mayy āveśya" means fixing the
mind on Me. "mano ye māṁ". Second time, the word is "māṁ". So, you know,
actually, fixing the mind on Me. And "māṁ nitya-yuktā upāsate". They worship Me
constantly. So, if we look at the previous verse, previous verse,
"satata-yuktā". "upāsate".

        evaṁ satata-yuktā ye
        bhaktās tvāṁ paryupāsate

So, the first two lines, whatever it was being talked about, that is what
Krishna is referring to over here. "yuktā upāsate". Same words are there. And
"nitya" is also there. Then, Arjuna had used the word "tvāṁ". Krishna is using
the word "māṁ". "māṁ" and "mayy". So, it is very clear. And then, you know, you
know, "vittamāḥ". "teṣāṁ ke yoga-vittamāḥ". And Arjuna is also using, Krishna is
alos using word "tamā". "yukta-tamā matāḥ". So, "śraddhayā parayopetās". With
transcendental faith. So, what Krishna is telling is those who fix their mind on
Krishna. You know. And worship Him. You know. Constantly. "mayy āveśya mano".
They fix the mind on Krishna. "māṁ nitya-yuktā upāsate". They worship Him
constantly with faith that is transcendental. They are the most intimately
united with Me. Now, a very significant point of this is that Krishna is using
"śraddhayā parayopetās". That their faith is, you know, transcendental. So, the
impersonal, you know, the mayavadis especially have the idea that we can choose
our "Ishta-Deva". And worship that particular form until we come to the level of
transcendence. When we go beyond to the, the form to the formless. So, that
conception is not supported by the Bhagavad Gita. Because it is "parayopetās".
"parayopetās" means that He is in the transcendental faith. So, with, with
tran..., with transcendental faith, one fixes the mind on Krishna. With
transcendental faith, one worships Krishna. So, it is not that we transcend
Krishna at a particular point. And go to the impersonal light. No. With
transcendental faith, that means even after we come to transcendence, we will
continue fixing the mind on Krishna. So, the, so, what Arjuna's question was,
Krishna has answered fa..., with crystal clear unambiguity. That those who
worship My, Me those who f..., worship, you know, you know, Me. And worship Me
with transcendental faith. They are the most intimately united with Me. So, now,
Prabhupada to make things even more clear, you know, translates, you know, you
know, here as they see:

"fix their minds on My personal form", 

My personal form. Now, we may say there is no reference to the word "rūpam". And
per..., there is no sanskrit equivalent to personal form in the original verse.
But the point is that Krishna has used very specific word like "māṁ". And
"mayy". And obviously, it is not that there is some light, impersonal light that
is speaking over there. It is, it is Krishna in a personal form standing in
front of Arjuna. And speaking. So, when Krishna is saying "māṁ", it means "māṁ".
If Krishna wanted to say, oh, you have to worship some light beyond Me. I am
that, I am just a temporary manifestation of that light. Then, Krishna would
have said like that. So, what is there in the verse, it may not be there in the
literal sanskrit of the verse. But it is implicit in the context of the verse.
Who is speaking this? It is Krishna in a personal form who is speaking it. And
He is referring to Himself. "māṁ". So:

"Those who fix their minds on My personal form and are always engaged in
worshiping Me with great and transcendental faith".

So, now, Krishna answers "yes". The personalists are the most intimately united
with Him. The personalists are most intimately united with Him. So, it is a very
clear answer. Krishna does not leave any scope for ambiguity. Now, even if there
are some ambiguity. If there are two alternatives. You know. Which were raised
in one ver..., in Arjuna's question. And then, naturally, the subsequent verses
will actually lead to, will, you know, analyse those two alternatives. So, the
second verse has analysed the first alternative. A third, fourth, fifth verses
will analyse the second alternative. And the second alternative also uses words
which make it clear what is being referred to. So, let us look at third and
fourth:

        ye tv akṣaram anirdeśyam
        avyaktaṁ paryupāsate
        sarvatra-gam acintyaṁ ca
        kūṭa-stham acalaṁ dhruvam

        sanniyamyendriya-grāmaṁ
        sarvatra sama-buddhayaḥ
        te prāpnuvanti mām eva
        sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ

So, you know, you know, Krishna has used the word, "ard...". Same words.
"akṣaram". And "avyaktaṁ". So, these are the words which were used by Arjuna in
his question.

        evaṁ satata-yuktā ye
        bhaktās tvāṁ paryupāsate
        ye cāpy akṣaram avyaktaṁ

So, whatever Arjuna has used, Krishna has used the same words. And He has given
some further words to describe, also. "akṣaram". "avyaktaṁ". And then, He says
"anirdeśyam". That which cannot be, "nirdeśyam". The description of it cannot
be, cannot pointed out to, to it. And then, how is it? "sarvatra-gam". It is
all-pervading. "acintyaṁ". He is inconceivable. "kūṭa-stham". It is
"kūṭa-stham". Fixed. Unchanging. "acalaṁ". Non-movable. "dhruvam". Just factual.
So, He gives how many attributes of that Absolute Truth? One. Two. Thr...,
"akṣaram anirdeśyam" is two. "avyaktaṁ" is three. Then, you know, two more in
the third, in C part of the verse. "sarvatra-gam acintyaṁ". It is five. And
three in the last part of the verse. You know. In the last line of the third
verse. 3D. "kūṭa-stham acalaṁ dhruvam". So, it is clear that He is referring to
the non-manifested aspect. The impersonal aspect. And then, what happens by this
is, he says, how, how is that to be worshipped? How do we worship the impersonal
manifestation of, of the Absolute Truth? T..., "sanniyamyendriya-grāmaṁ". You
know. "sanniyamyendriya-grāmaṁ". "niyam", "indriya". You know. You know. So, one
has to have, one has to have the "niyam". One has to have st..., strict rules
and regulations. You know. So, sen..., "ni...", "indriya-grāmam". to control all
the senses. And then, "sarvatra sama-buddhayaḥ". One tries to have an equal
vision towards everything. And "te prāpnuvanti mām eva". That "te prāpnuvanti".
They will also obtain Me. And Krishna says "eva". Certainly. You know. When?
"sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ". So, in this verse, Krishna does not ev..., you know,
speak anything negative about these people. It is, they will also obtain Me.
Certainly, they will obtain Me. But the next verse, He will describe that, oh,
it is not so easy. Next verse, He will say "kleśo ’dhika-taras teṣām". We will
look at that verse. But here, basically, what Krishna is telling is, He, as far
as He is concerned, Arjuna's question was, who are most intimately united? Yes.
Those who fix their mind on Me are most intimately united. And, you know, the
others, they will also come to Me. But then, there is a, you know, complex
process that they have to follow. You know. The, the process is basically
centered on equanimity. On, you know, equal vision towards everything. And
towards everyone. So, now, let us look at the next verse. And then, we will
elaborate on this further. You know. You know.

        kleśo ’dhika-taras teṣām
        avyaktāsakta-cetasām
        avyaktā hi gatir duḥkhaṁ
        dehavadbhir avāpyate

So, now, if you see, there are so, you know, there are two words which are very
clear. "kle...", indicating something negative. "kleśaḥ". And "duḥkhaṁ".
"kleśaḥ" is trouble. "duḥkhaṁ" is misery. So, "kleśaḥ". "adhika-taraḥ".
"adh...", "adhika-taraḥ" means very much. So, "adhika-ta...", "adhika-taraḥ"
means largely. Mostly. You know. Viddh..., "teṣām". Those people. Who are these
people? They were referred in the previous verse. They will get "kleśaḥ".
"avyaktāsakta-cetasām". So, their consciousness is attached to the impersonal
manifestation. That means they are attracted to the impersonal aspect of the
Absolute Truth. "avyaktā hi gatir duḥkhaṁ". So, those who, you know, make
"avyaktā" the goal of their life. "gatir duḥkhaṁ". Progress is very di...,
difficult for them. "dehavadbhir avāpyate". "dehavadbhir". Those who are
embodied. "avāpyate". So, progress is very troublesome when the attachment to
the impersonal aspect is there. Especially, for those who are embodied. So, why
is it troublesome? Because it is, you know, difficult for us. To con...,
conceive or concentrate on that which has, you know, no form. Actually, we have
discussed earlier about the negative axis. And the positive axis. You remember.
So, the material form is in the negative axis. The spiritual form is in the
positive axis. And the impersonal Brahman is like the zero point. So, just, you
know, giving, you know, just giving up the material form, the attraction to the
material forms. And trying to concentate the mind on nothing. On the
attributeless, activitiless Brahman. It is very difficult for, you know,
everyone in general. And especially for the embodied soul. You know. We, you
know, generally have to think in terms of forms and things. And the impersonal
is something which is very difficult to think about. So, we are all used to
forms. And if we are just told, do not think about any form. Then, it is very
difficult. What do you think about? It is just as, it is extremely difficult to
create a vacuum. And it is extremely easy to destroy a vacuum. If I take a
glass. And I decide I want to make the glass empty. So, I just put there some
water in it I throw away. I may say it has become empty. But still, it is filled
with air. You know. If I have to remove the air, it is very difficult. It is a
laborious process. And then, even if I succeed in removing all the air. And
creating a perfect vacuum over there. What, the, what is going to happen? The
moment, some, you know, opening comes up. Some no..., hole, air, some hole or
some sort of space is left, you know, open, then tuck. Air will come inside. So,
vacuum is extremely difficult to create. And even more difficult to sustain. So,
like that, basically, the impersonal, meditating on the impersonal aspect is
like creating a vacuum in the consciousness. That mens do not think about
anything. Why do not think about anything? Because all material forms and
material attributes are rejected as negative. As entangling. As a part of
illusion which need to be given up. But then, there is no positive spiritual
conception. In terms of forms. Activities. Attributes. So, then, what is there
to think about? It is very, very difficult. So, now, "dehavadbhir avāpyate". For
those who are embodied. Now, the impersonalists may argue. That, ok, actually,
the impersonal reality is the actual reality. But as long as we are embodied,
just difficult to think about it. Once, we go beyond the embodiment, embodied,
then we will be able to think about it. And then, that is the ultimate reality.
But Krishna is telling, you know, because you are embodied, you cannot think
about it. No. Kri..., actually speaking, that can be, interpretation which one
can make if that is one what, that is what one wants to, you know, do.

But that is not an interpretation that is supported by the Bhagavad Gita. We
will see the next verses, also. Krishna says that I personally lift those who
devote Myself s..., to Me, themselves to Me. You know. "teṣām ahaṁ samuddhartā".
But rel..., you know, apart from the nex..., you know, immediate context where,
of the overall tenor is fix the mind on Me. If the, important thing is, Krishna
has not said anywhere that bhakti is only for the less intelligent people. You
know. Krishna has not said anywhere that once we become more intelligent, we
will go beyond the personal form to something higher. So, here, the
"dehavadbhir" point is not, Krishna does not say that, ok, it is "kleśaḥ" as
long as you are "dehavadbhir". But afterwards, when there is no "dehavadbhir",
when you do not have the embody, then it will no longer be "kleśaḥ". Krishna
does not say that. Krishna simply makes the point that because we are embodied.
And we used to, you know, thinking about forms. So, it is difficult for us to
think of anything which is embo..., disassem..., which is formless.
Attributeless. Attributeless. Activitiless. But that does not mean that the
formless. Attributeless. Activitiless thing is the ultimate truth. It is
difficult. And it is also not the ultimate truth. How is, how do we know that is
not the ultimate truth? Because there are so many verses which Krishna has said
that He, He, when He is saying "I". He is referring to Himself "I". "ahaṁ
sarvasya prabhavo". 10.8. "mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat". 7.7. "mayādhyakṣeṇa
prakṛtiḥ". In 9.10. So many places, He has said. And then, "avyaktā".
"avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā". The, here, here, He is contrasting, He is saying those
who think that the impersonal is higher. He is saying, they are "mūḍhā". And
then:

        avyaktaṁ vyaktim āpannaṁ
        manyante mām abuddhayaḥ

So, 9.11 and 7.24. They are two important verses where Krishna does very clearly
say that the impersonal aspect is not the, you know, is not the highest. And in
fact, those who think that the impersonal is higher than the personal, they are
completely mistaken. They are totally misled. So, you know, the "dehavadbhir" is
simply illustrating the point here, is simply drawing attention to the point
that as it is, we are, you know, accustomed to thinking in a particular way
because of having a body. And as we are accustomed to thinking in a particular
way, so, this is difficult to think about. So, this "dehavadbhir" has got
noth..., does not contain any implication about the nature of ultimate reality.
It does not in any way state that the ultimate reality is perso..., impersonal.
All that it says is in our current situation where we have a body. And we are
habituated to bodily activity, it is very difficult for us to think of that
which is, you know, you know, which is having no qualities. No attr..., no
activities. Nothing practically speaking. So, is it that when one is in the mode
of goodness, one can think of the impersonal aspect better? And when one is
transcen..., transcendental, one can think of the impersonal aspect more?
Actually speaking, you know, our obsession with material forms will become less
and less. You know. When we rise from the lower modes towards the higher modes.
So, when one is in goodness, one is more con..., contemplative. And when one is
more contemplative, surely, one can think more about certain features of the
Absolute Truth. You know. But that does not necessarily mean that, that is the
highest Abso..., aspect of the Absolute Truth. This is, relatively speaking, if
one wants to meditate on something impersonal, it might be easier if one is less
attached to the body. Less attached to the bodily conception. But that is not a
comment, you know, indicating that the Absolute, impersonal aspect is itself the
highest aspect of the Absolute Truth. You know. It is, it is just that that is
the nature of our conditioning. When we are in passion, we have to act at the
bodily level a lot. When we are in goodness, our activity is more at the
intellectual level. We do not need to act so much at the bodily level. You know.
It is said that there are, you know, three kinds of people. Some people make
things happen. Some people watch things happen. And some people wonder what
happened. So, this can, this is a, quote, there is a quote by some materialistic
thinker. But these can, these three can be roughly ir..., correlated with the
three modes. Some people make things happen. And goodness, people then, you
know, themselves are running around. They are thinking. And they make things 26:15
