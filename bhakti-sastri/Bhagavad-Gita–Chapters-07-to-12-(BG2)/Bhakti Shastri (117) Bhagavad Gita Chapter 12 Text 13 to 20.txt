Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. Now, we
are in the last part of the Twelfth Chapter. The Twelfth Chapter had three
sections. First was how the impersonal conception is subordinate to the personal
conception. Or rather, worship of the personal concept, personal, you know,
Absolute Truth is higher. Is preferable to worship of the impersonal aspect of
the Absolute Truth. Then, the second section was, within the multiple, within,
once we understood bhakti is the best way, then, you know, then the various
levels at which bhakti can be practiced. And now, from thirt..., you know, 13th
to 20th. So, 1 to 6 was the first section. You know. You know. 1 to 7, actually.
And then, 8 to 12 was the second section. Now, 13 to 20 is the section, you
know, that, you know, which are the qualities that endear one to Krishna. So,
that mean..., you know, first is, generally, whenever we do any activity, there,
when..., whenever is, there is any path, there are three aspects to it. First
is, one's, you know, mentality. One's conceptions. Then, there is the activity.
And then, there is the quality. So, as per as mentality or conception is
concerned, Krishna tells very clearly that the per..., you know, once you will
consider the personal conception to be the highest. Recognise that. Then, the,
in terms of activities, various levels, at which, one can practice spiritual
life has been discussed. When verses 8 to 12. Especially, not just spiritual
life in general. But, you know, devotional service. Bhakti yoga at the various
levels at which it can be practiced. And then, now, from 13 onwards, the various
qualities that endear one to Krishna will be discussed. So, so, 12.13-14 are
given as a single verse.

        adveṣṭā sarva-bhūtānāṁ
        maitraḥ karuṇa eva ca
        nirmamo nirahaṅkāraḥ
        sama-duḥkha-sukhaḥ kṣamī

        santuṣṭaḥ satataṁ yogī
        yatātmā dṛḍha-niścayaḥ
        mayy arpita-mano-buddhir
        yo mad-bhaktaḥ sa me priyaḥ

So, several of these verses will end with a chorus like "yo mad-bhaktaḥ sa me
priyaḥ". "sa me priyaḥ" will be, or "priyaman". So, the word "priyaḥ" will be
common in most of the verses that will follow in this section. And the, these
are the, what, a devotee who renders devotional service, you know, while
cultivating. Or while possessing qualities like this is dear to Me. You know.
Now, Krishna has earlier said that, you know, you know, you know, you know, He
continues to care for and protect, you know, value. You know. Even the sinful.
In Ninth Chapter, in 30th and 31st verses, Krishna has explained how He values
everyone. But then, in the next verse, after that, explaining in 30th verse how
He values everyone, He says that "api cet su-durācāro". So, even the, who are
terribly sinful. Krishna considers even them to be, you know, "sādhuḥ". "sādhur
eva sa mantavyaḥ". To be saintly. You know. Then, then He says that, they will
all be per..., I will protect them. And Arjuna, you declare it.

        kaunteya pratijānīhi
        na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati

So, He says, I, I declare that they will be protected. So, we could say that,
this is also an expression of Krishna's love. Yes. Definitely. But love also has
many levels. You know. A mother will love her baby. But mother may not trust the
baby. You know. The mother loves the baby. And that is why if the baby gets a
knife. And, you know, you know, her hands. Then, the mother will want to, you
know, take the knife away from the baby girl. Why? Because that, you know, girl
does not at, n..., baby girl does not right now have the understanding of how to
use the knife properly. So, love can be of multiple levels. But the same,
suppose, that same baby girl grows as to become a, you know, responsible. And
intelligent daughter. Then, she can take the knife. And she can do excellent
cooking in the kitchen. So, what that means is, that time, the mother has got
not only love. But trust. So, love can be of multiple levels. So, now, Kri...,
you know, you know, the, when Krishna speaks that even those who are sinful, I
protect them. And I ensure they will be protected. Arjuna, you declare that they
will be protected. Oh, oh, My devotees will never perish. So, that is an
expression of His love. Bu..., you know, now, He certainly loves all living
beings. And He loves even the sinful. But then, there are, as we have discussed
earlier, Krishna is, you know, not partial. But He is reciprocal. So, naturally,
those devotees who reciprocate with Him more and more. Attract His attention
more anad more. They love Him. You know. They, you know, carve a greater and
greater place in Krishna's heart themselves because of their devotion. So, now,
in this section, Krishna will describe how, when devotee, so, anybody who is
practicing devotional service, that person is dear to Krishna. At the same time,
d..., if devotees also have virtuous qualities, then that endears them to
Krishna all the more. So, in this section, Krishna is telling us that, you know,
it is not that, we should just, we should just assume that we cannot whitewash
ourselves just because we are devotees. You know. The idea of whitewashing is,
you know, you know, putting, you know, making somebody a completely blame free.
You know. This person is very good. There is no fault on the si..., on the side
of this person. This person is perfectly, a perfect virtuous person. That is
called whitewashing. Now, we cannot whitewash any..., you know, we should not
let devotional service become our whitewash. You know. Actually, devotional
service has the potency to tru..., truly whitewash us. Now, whitewash, not in
the sense of giving us a, you know, you know, an external appearance of a, you
know, a whiteness. Now, generally, the white, color white often signifies
purity. So, the, you know, whitewash should, is, you know, that bhakti can give
us a, not just in..., external. It is also internal. It is not just external
that a devotee become, should, you know, look, you know, clean and pure. But
internally, also, the devotee should have clean and pure desires. And bhakti
will truly, you know, internally whitewash us. But that is a process. And we
have to let the process act on us. You know. All of us are a works in progress.
You know. Now, without the connection of Krishna, then our progress may take
many, many lifetimes. And in-between, befo..., with, there might also be
regress. So, we might be works in regress, also. A work in progress refers to
something that is right now going on. You know.

If something is being cooked in the kitchen. At that time, it, before it is
being cooked. Say, delicius puris are going to be made. But when they are in the
stage of ata, they do not, or even if the ata is made by, you know, is, you
know, made in to, you know, dough. And it is being rolled. At that time, it does
not water, generally, water the mouth of anyone. Why? Because at that stage, it
is a process. It is a work in progress. So, like that, all of us are right now
in work, are works in progress. But, you know, now, if, if, who, how do we, you
know, how do we progress? You know. You know. It is Krishna who is working on
us. And to the extent we cooperate with Krishna. To that extent, we, you know,
progress farther and farther to..., further and further towards perfection.
Faster and faster towards perfection. You know. But the same time, it is we who
are works in progress. And it is we who have to actually the represent...,
responsibility of progressing. Nobody else can take that responsibility for us.
And, you know, that means that we should not, we should actually let Krishna
purify us. And elevate us. And ultimately, liberate us. And that involves also
de..., now, this has not been that the devotee has to necessarily strive for
qualities independent of bhakti. There is that famous verse.

    yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā
    sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ
    harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā
    manorathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ
 
So, this is the verse which Prabhupada would often quote to show how actually,
you know, a devotee has all the good qualities that a, that even the devatas
have got. You know. And on the other hand, what good qualities can non-devotees
have? Because they are always on the mental platform. And they will be driven
away. Dragged away by their uncontrolled mind. So, now, if here, we see that,
you know, it is said that a devotee has all the good qualities of the devatas.
Now, do the devatas really have good qualities? We see Indra tries to, this, you
know, to secude the wife of "Gautama Maharishi". "Ahalya". Or even Brahmaji runs
after his daughter. So, do the devatas really have good qualities? Actually
speaking, those are only occ..., you know, very, very rare, you know, misdeeds
in the part of these devatas. And because they are the, so rare, so that is why
they are talked about in the Vedic literature. So, the idea for, about talking
about them is that, you know, the primary purpose is not, you know, that these
are such great personalities. That, you know, you know, improper behavior from
them is so extraordinary. So unlike, extraordinary not in a positive sense. But
in a negative sense. So unlikely. So improbable. So uncharacteristic. That when
it happens, it becomes no to adi. You know. He, if a three months old baby
cries. You know. All three months old babies cry. So, that is, you know, normal.
And, you know, that will not come in the news. Even a three months old baby
cries. Nobody is going to make that in the newspaper headline. But if, you know,
a 30 years old man, you know, because he has lost a bet, or something like that,
starts crying. You know. That becomes unusual. So, when the, when we say the
devatas, if they do some wrong deed, we should not think that they are only
always doing wrong deeds. They are normally, are very, you know, you know, they
are very, they are virtuous in their behavior. They are dharmic. And, you know,
the point of talking about the misdeeds of the devatas is to, you know,
illustrate how the power of illusion is so great that even such great
personalities can be overcome by its power. So, but in general, devatas have
good qualities. Now, if we look at the section in the "Bhāgavatam" where this
verse comes.

    yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā

These, it, the section primarily talk glorifying the process of bhakti. So, you
know, the, the verse emphasis is that actually, you know, bhakti will engender
good qualities. Whereas abhaktas, you know, you know, you know, non-devotees may
temporarily have some positive qualities. But those qualities will not stay.
Because they do not have any sustainable foundation for those qualities. See, a
house may look very magnificent. But if it has no foundation, it will just
tumble whenever there is a storm. Similarly, the good qualities that people
have. If they do not have a devotional foundation. Then, their qualities are
based on, their, you know, you know, cultivation and dedication to those
qualities is based on, you know, some con..., conceptions. Some worldly
conceptions. Oh, this is good for me. And this is good for others. This is how I
should behave. And those are, you know, noteworthy. Those are noteworthy in one
sense. But then, they are not sustainable. If circumstances change, then their
ideas of morality may also change. So, that is why, you know, the emphasis of
this verse is not that automatically, a devotee has good qualities. The, you
know, verse is that, bhakti is the means for sustainable development of good
qualities. Because bhakti will change our self-conception. And bhakti will, you
know, help us understand how truly, how good qualities are actually enate, enate
nature. And being parts and parcels of Krishna. And behaving according to those
good qualities is the best way for us to make steady spiritual advancement. And
to actually do good for ourselves as well as for others. Because when we act
with virtues, then we allow Krishna to act through us. When we are not acting
virtuously, then we block Krishna from acting for acting to us, for us. And when
we do not allow Krishna to act through us, then the result is that we suffer.
And others suffer. So, we act according to our own ideas. And we make a mess of
our lives. So, now, let us look at this, this background. So, the point of these
verses is not that, this bhakti can help us to develop qualities automatically.
But that does not mean that we should let bhak..., you know, imagine that bhakti
has already whitewashed us. You know. We should also strive to develop the good
qualities. But how do we strive? Within the realm of devotional service, while
practicing devotional service, we try to exhibit these good qualities as much as
possible. So, "adveṣṭā sarva-bhūtānāṁ". So, "sarva-bhūtānāṁ". All living beings.
"adveṣṭā". Such a person is non-envious. Non-envious friend of all living
beings. "adveṣṭā sarva-bhūtānāṁ". So, you know, you know, such a person is, you
know, non-envious. And then, not only non-envious. "maitraḥ karuṇa eva ca".
"maitraḥ karuṇa" means a compassionate friend. So, that means there are two
things. Generally, in this world, when we find that somebody is, you know,
su..., very successful, prosperous, often, envy comes in our heart. Why is this
person so good? You know. Somebody may have a better car than us. A better, you
know, house than us. A better job than us. And then, we start feeling envious of
such a person. But devotee understands that actually, no asset in this world can
bring true happin..., true happiness. And that is why whatever materialistic
people have, that is not going to be the source of their happiness. See, our
happiness does not depend on what we have. Our happiness depends on what we do
with we have. Our depends on not on what we have. But on what we do with what we
have.

So, a person may have a lot of wealth. But if that person uses that for
drinking. Then, that person is actually poisoning one's own body. And then,
ruining one's own future. But that person uses that wealth for some constructive
activity. Then, that wealth can be a source of happiness. So, you know, you
know, bhakti helps us to understand what is the best, you know, way to use our
wealth. And that is how bhakti can become the source of, you know, bhakti can
enable us to engage wealth in Krishna's service. And thereby, experience a
richer, deeper connection with Krishna which is the ultimate basis of all
lasting happiness. Of the best happiness in life. So, again, you know, the point
here is that, bec..., a devotee does, does, does not, you know, have the
illusion that anything material can make me happy. Ok. That person may have
better car than me. But the car is just a tool for going from one place to
another. It is, car is not going to make me happy. The, so, that way, a devotee
is not disturbed. You know. You know. You know. The, because others have
something better than him, because and, that devotee. So, that is why this
"adveṣṭā sarva-bhūtānāṁ". So, at the material level, there is envy. A devotee
has no envy towards others. But that is not alone. That, that, so, non-negative,
in and of itself is not positive. That would just mean that devotee is not
envious. But a devotee's vision towards others is also beyond that. It is
positive. "maitraḥ karuṇa eva ca". How "maitraḥ karuṇa eva ca"? Because a
devotee understands, you know, you know, that everyone is a part of the same
one family of the Supreme Lord. We are all children. And we are all related in
Krishna's family. And that is why "maitraḥ karuṇa". One, it is a well-wishing
friend of all living beings. And then:

        nirmamo nirahaṅkāraḥ
        sama-duḥkha-sukhaḥ kṣamī

You know. So, Krishna has talked about, you know, "nirmamaḥ" and "nirahaṅkāraḥ"
several times. The first time he talked about, it was in 2.71. 2.70 was
"āpūryamāṇam". And 2.71 was, you know, you know, you know, you know:

        āpūryamāṇam acala-pratiṣṭhaṁ
        samudram āpaḥ praviśanti yadvat
        tadvat kāmā yaṁ praviśanti sarve
        sa śāntim āpnoti na kāma-kāmī

        vihāya kāmān yaḥ sarvān
        pumāṁś carati niḥspṛhaḥ
        nirmamo nirahaṅkāraḥ
        sa śāntim adhigacchati

So, in 2.70 and 71, Krishna is talking about giving up material desires. And
there, He says in 2.71, "nirmamo nirahaṅkāraḥ". You know. That to give up the
conception of, you know, "mamaḥ". This is mine. And "ahaṅkāraḥ". That this body
and whatever conn..., this recognition that are connected with the body, that,
that, I am that. To let those bodily designations become our self-definition is
illusion. And to give that up is the process of, you know, liberation from
illusion. So, "nirmamo nirahaṅkāraḥ". That devotee also has the tendency to
possess. But, you know, you know, a devotee understands that the ultimate
possession is Krishna. As "Bhaktivinoda Thakur" says in a famou..., in the song,
Vaishnava song, "Atma Nivedana Tuwa Pade". He says:

        āmi to’ tomāra,  tumi to’ āmāra,
        ki kāja apara dhane

So, my dear Lord, I am Yours. You are mine. What other wealth do I want? So,
this is how a devotee, you know, he becomes free from that possessive mentality.
Because devotee understands that I have got the supreme possession of Krishna. So:

        nirmamo nirahaṅkāraḥ
        sama-duḥkha-sukhaḥ kṣamī

So, we have discussed earlier how a devotee becomes equipoised. It is, suppose,
I have five crore rupees in one hand. And then, I have five rupees in another
hand. Or maybe, fifty paise in another hand. So, now, if that fi.., if that,
say, five rupee coin is all that I have. If I do not have these five crore
rupees. I have only five rupees. And then, if I see that coin falling away.
Then, I will become agitated. No. No. That coin. I want to get it. And if
somebody comes and steals it. Also, I will get agitated. I will get worked up.
That I have to figh..., preserve this coin. And also, you know, you know, if
somebody gives me five rupees more. Or one more five rupee coin, I will become
excited. Oh, I have got, got five more, five, you know, five rupees more. So,
generally, if the five rupees is all that we have, then we will get very worked
up if somebody takes it away. And we will get excited if somebody gives it more,
also. But if I have five crore rupees in one hand. And then, I have five rupees
in another hand. You know. Then, that five rupees, even if I lose it, it will
not make much difference to me. In fact, if that five rupee is, if I am going
along. And I see some beggar. I might just to..., you know, toss those five
rupees. And when the five rupee coin spins away. And beggar pauses. And takes
it. We can, we will say "take it". Why? Because when we compare that we have
something of greater value. If I have five crore, then with five rupee is
insigificant. But if I do not have the five crore. Then, five rupees is all that
I have. And that becomes super significant for me. So, like that, you know, the
five rupees is the, is the material pleasures. The material possessions.
Material positions that we have. And the five crore is our spiritual wealth. Our
devotional connection with Krishna. So, to the extent we do not have a strong
devotional connection. To that extent, material ups and downs shake us. Shake
us. You know. Success will, you know, make us jubilant. And, you know, you know,
failure will make us despondent. So, these sort of dualities will not affect us,
to the extent will, our vision is fixed on Krishna. And we have a strong
relationship with Krishna. And the, you know, regular experience, the
fulfillment that comes with the strong connection with Krishna. So, that is how
"sama-duḥkha-sukhaḥ kṣamī". You know. A devotee understands that everything
material is temporary. And from the point of the view the soul's eternal
happiness, the pleasures and pains of this world are temporary. Therefore,
"sama-duḥkha-sukhaḥ". That they are, one, one can be equipoisod in happiness and
distress. "kṣamī". As Prabhupada translates "kṣamī", you know, you know, you
know, you know, as forgiving. The word "kṣamī" is related with the word "kṣama".
So, even if somebody offends a devotee. Devotee, offense, what, no big deal
about it. I do not know. Do not have to get, get worked up over to be, I will
discuss this about, this, a little bit more, later. Then, "santuṣṭaḥ satataṁ
yogī". Because a devotee delights in one's internal connection with Krishna,
that is why devotee does not water too much about worldly things. "santuṣṭaḥ
satataṁ yogī". You know. It is, devotee is yogi. Why? Yogi is one who strives
for a connection through yoga. So, a devotee is striving for a connection with
Krishna through bhakti yoga. And then, "santuṣṭaḥ satataṁ". That devotee is
always satisfied. Because devotee understands that, ultimately, the relationship
with Krishna is, the service to Krishna is all that I need. I do not need
anything else. 

And these brings the life's supreme satisfaction. Therefore, I have, now that I
have this, I do not have to worry bout anything else. Then, "yatātmā
dṛḍha-niścayaḥ". "yatātmā". "yata-ātmā". Self-control. Strongly determined.
"dṛḍha-niścayaḥ". You know. You know. You know. You know. Now, if we might, now,
we should not imagine, when we, you know, reach such exalted qualities of a
devotee. That all this comes easily. And naturally. You know. Sometimes, people
have the idea that, you know, we see some very advanced, saintly devotees. They
are very, you know, you know, they are very humble. Very tolerant. Very, you
know, be, you know, you know, gentle. Gently, gentle-mannered. And we may
wonder. When we see such exalted dev..., such devotees with advanced qualities
that, oh, they are at such a high level. I can never attain that level.
Therefore, you know, let me, let me just stay where I am. So, we sometimes think
that, you know, at the qualities of advanced devotees are just something other
bobba..., are their congenital assets. You know. Or something that they have got
from birth. Actually, even, even most material skills are not congenital assets.
You know. Even somebody is a phenomenal tennis player. A phenomenal, you know,
you know, you know, cricket player. You know. Even they often have to practice.
Then, they develop those good qualit..., you know, their virtue. Somebody may be
excellent spin bowler. An expert bowler. Somebody, you know, but then, that, it
is not that the person was born with wingers. You know. Ha..., that is not that
the person came out of the mother's womb with a ball. And that person started
swi..., swinging everything inside. Throwing in legs swing balls. Even if the
person may have a little bit talents. Actually, even to express material talents
requires work. So, same way, a devotee should understand that even if some, the
other devotees seem to be very tolerant. Very advanced. And we think, oh, I do
not have these qualities. These devotees must have done lot of advancement in
their previous life. Well, it may be. But that does not mean that was struggle
free. See, when they went through it, they had to struggle. So, as, similarly,
we have to struggle for it. You know. If we think, oh, the, I cannot behave like
those advanced devotees. Because they have done so much bhakti from previous
life. So, what do I do then? Then, I just keep on my lack result of practice.
And what will happen as, who knows? Maybe, in my previous life, also, I said the
same thing. In the previous life, when I saw some advanced devotees. I thought.
Oh, they also practiced bhakti in their previous life. I cannot be like them.
You know. That is why I thought. And I lost that chance at that time. And, you
know, I did not do serious adva..., spiritual advancement. And this life, I am
saying the same thing. Oh, these devotees are so advanced. So, what may happen
next life, also? I may say the same thing. Then, how, where will we get
inspiration from? We have to understand that if anybody has become an advanced
devotee, you know, that person has become advanced by the practice of
spirituality. By the practice of devotion. And by the struggle against the
anarthas. Of course, there may be a few exceptional nitya-siddha devotees. You
know. Who are eternally connected. And eternally, who are, you know, who are,
who descend from the spiritual world. But we should not assume that everybody is
nitya-siddha. Actually, you know, the advanced devotees, we should assume that
they also have gone through the struggle. You know. This, we do not say in terms
of seeing them materially. But in terms of recognising that, we should not
you know, you know, you know, we should not escape, expect that, str...,
anytime, there will be no struggles for us. 25:35
