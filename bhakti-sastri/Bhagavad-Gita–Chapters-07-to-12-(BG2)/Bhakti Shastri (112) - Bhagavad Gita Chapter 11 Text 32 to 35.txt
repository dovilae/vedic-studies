Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are
in the Eleventh Chapter. The last chapter we discussed about, in the last class,
we discussed about Arjuna's description of the vision of the universal form.
And, you know, first, he was describing the universal form. Then, he described
the reactions of the various residents, you know, you know, to the perception of
the universal form. Then, he described his own emotions. And then, after that,
he described, the, suddenly, the vision comes down on the battlefield. And he
sees the various warriors there getting destroyed. Devoured. So, we discussed
there about the significance of the destructive aspect of God. So, God de...,
you know, destroys the temporary to make way for the eternal. And then, Arjuna
concluded with the question, who are You? So, from verse 32 onwards, you know,
the "viśva-rūpa" speaks. So, actually, it is Krishna itself. That says the
Bhaga..., "Sañjaya" does not say "śrī-viśva-rūpa uvāca". He says "śrī-bhagavān
uvāca". So, let us see what He says. You know.

        śrī-bhagavān uvāca

        kālo ’smi loka-kṣaya-kṛt pravṛddho
        lokān samāhartum iha pravṛttaḥ
        ṛte ’pi tvāṁ na bhaviṣyanti sarve
        ye ’vasthitāḥ praty-anīkeṣu yodhāḥ

So, "kālo ’smi". Time I am. And what have I come for? "loka-kṣaya-kṛt
pravṛddho". I have come for destroying the worlds. So, Kri..., Arjuna had asked
two questions. You know. "ākhyāhi me ko bhavān ugra-rūpo". Who are You? You
know. And second was "na hi prajānāmi tava pravṛttim". I do not know what is
Your purpose. So, in that sense, the question also includes, what is Your
purpose? I want to know. So, in the first line, itself, both are described
succinctly. "kālo ’smi". I am time. Time I am. The destroyer of all the worlds.
And what have I done? I have come here for "loka-kṣaya-kṛt pravṛddho".
"loka-kṣaya". For destruction of the whole worlds. "kṛt pravṛddho". "lokān
samāhartum iha pravṛttaḥ". So, all the worlds will be engaged in destruction.
All the worlds means, the principle kings of the worlds will be engaged in
destruct..., mutual destruction. And then:

        ṛte ’pi tvāṁ na bhaviṣyanti sarve
        ye ’vasthitāḥ praty-anīkeṣu yodhāḥ

So, "praty-anīkeṣu yodhāḥ" is all those warriors who are assembled over here,
they will be destroyed. You know. And "ṛte ’pi tvāṁ". "ṛte ’pi", "ṛte" can mean
except for you. Or it can mean without you. So, except for you means, actually,
everybody will be destroyed. But you will not be destroyed. So, we know that the
Kauravas were defeated. And the Pandavas were victorious. And when, you know,
you know, "Karṇa" fell on the 17th day. Shalya became the commander for the 18th
day. And Shalya was killed by "Yudhiṣṭhira". And after that, you know, the few
remains of, you know, you know, Duryodhana's soldiers tried to fight. And
Shakuni was killed by Sahadeva. At that time, Duryodhana fled. And then, he was
hiding under a lake. And, you know, you know, "Bhīma" found him. Challenged him.
And defeated him. And he was, he was, he were laid mortally wounded dying. So,
at that time, the Pandavas thought they had won the war. But that night,
"Aśvatthāmā" came. And brutally slaughtered, the, all the Kaurava warriors. So,
the, all the Pandava warriors. However, because of that tradition, that the
warriors who win the war, in order to sort of proclaim their victory. And lay
their claim on the, you know, land which they have won, the tradition was that
they sleep on the battlefield. On the battleground. So, they, you know, Pandavas
were sleeping on the battleground. And the, you know, the remaining soldiers who
were in the camp. You know. Soldiers. Warriors. Commanders. Everyone. So, they
were slaughtered by "Aśvatthāmā" with vica..., with "Kŗtavarmā". And
Kripacharya. And, you know, in this way, practically, everybody was killed. So,
the five Pandavas remained. Even the Pandava's sons were killed. Apart from
that, the only persons who remained were, you know, these three people.
"Aśvatthāmā". "Kŗta...", "Kŗtavarmā". And "Vik...". And, you know, "Kṛpa". And
from the Pandava's side, Krishna was still there. Then, "Sātyaki" was a "Yadava"
warrio..., warrior. Who, the only "Yadava" warriors who fought in the Kaurava,
in the war were "Sātyaki" on the side of the Pandavas. And "Kŗtavarmā" on the
side of the Kauravas. "Kŗtavarmā" was the commander of the Narayani Sena. And
along with the Narayani Sena, he came to fight. When Narayani Sena was chosen by
Duryodhana. Before the war took place. So, he also came. And "Sātyaki" was a
very close friend, you know, student of Arjuna. Friend and student. You know. He
had, he, he had also been at the, you know, gurukula of "Droṇā". And he had
learnt some things over there. But Arjuna had honed, you know, had, had honed
his skills through those, you know, intense training while Arjuna was in, you
know, Dwarka. So, they were very close. "Sātyaki" had also fought. "Sātyaki" was
there in the same place where the Pandavas were resting for the night. So,
these, you know, that means, practically, only these seven people. The five
Pandavas. You know. "Sātyaki" and Krishna on the side of the, you know,
Kaurav..., on Pandavas. And then, you know, these "Kŗtavarmā". "Kṛpa". And, you
know, "Aśvatthāmā" on the side of the Kauravas. And of course, there was one,
one more Kaurava who was actually a half son. Or, ha..., or, or a half brother
of the hundred Kauravas. So, he had been born, you know, from "Dhṛtarāṣṭra"
through a maidservant. And he had defected over to the Pandavas just before the
war had started. And he performed the final rites of all the Kauravas. So, he
also survived. So, practically, nobody survived.

        ṛte ’pi tvāṁ na bhaviṣyanti sarve

So, except for you, everybody will be destroyed. Now, you know, that means the
"kalarupa" is coming. And the "kalarupa" is ferocious for the materialist. And,
but for the devotees, the "kalarupa" is not ferocious. Just like Nrsimhadeva was
ferocious for the d..., d..., demons. But Nrsimhadeva was the abode of love for
Prahlad. And the same Nrsimhadeva who was roaring, like a fero..., fearsome,
frightening lion, started paring and passing like a gentle cat. When Prahlad
came in front of him, he offered obeisances. And then, "Nrsimhadeva" touched his
hand on Prahlad's head. So, we see, there is two pictures of "Nrsimhadeva". One
is roaring. Very fearsome. The other is smiling. Putting the hand of Prahlad.
So, you know, there is a famous verse from, you know, Shreedhar Swami whose
"istadeva" was Nrsimha. He said:

        anugra api ugra evayam

So, he said:

        potanam svakesari

Just as a lion is, is extremely fierce for everyone, except her own cubs.
Similarly, a, you know, the Lord Nar..., Lord in the form of "Nrsimhadeva" is
fierce for everyone. But not for His devotees. So, same way, here, also, you
know, actually, you know, the "ugra". The "Nara...", the "Virata rupa" does not
destroy the Pandavas. And "ṛte ’pi tvāṁ". Except for you. That is one way of
understanding it. And the "ṛte ’pi" can mean, another explanation is, even
without you. "ṛte" can mean without. The, what does it mean? It means that even
if you do not fight. Still, I have come here as time. And I am going to destroy
everyone. So, that means the destruction of the warriors is already ordained.
By divine arrangement. And even if you do not do it, you think that, oh, you
know, I do. I will not fight. I will not en..., curse in full reactions. I will
not kill my relatives. Still, their killing is already ordained. And that is
going to happen. You cannot stop that. That is the emphasis of "ṛte ’pi tvāṁ".
So, now, you know, here, there is an interesting verse from the "Kaṭha
Upaniṣad". Which also illustrates the point of how the Lord's glory is
all-sided. So:

        yasya brahma ca kṣatraṁ ca
        ubhe bhavata odanaḥ
        mṛtyur yasyopasecanaṁ
        ka itthā veda yatra saḥ

So, now, here, it is said that, it is quite a scary verse in one way. "yasya
brahma ca kṣatraṁ ca". That means brahmanas and ksatriyas. "ubhe bhavata
odanaḥ". So, they are all consumed. Devoured like a mill by the Supre..., meal
by the Supreme. "mṛtyur yasyopasecanaṁ". So, that, actually, as time, as time,
as the form of death actually consumes everyone. And who can know such a form of
the Absolute Truth? What does it mean? It, you know, again, we may have some
d..., disturbing notions of, you know, cannibalism over here. You know. Ca...,
you know, one thing is non-vegetarianism. Non-vegetarianism is to eat meat. But
cannibalism is to eat human flesh. Which is barbaric. It is outlawed according
to international law. And the practice might be there in some remote places. But
it is quite a barbaric idea for any civilised person. So, what, what, how, what
to speak of any human being doing it? Then, what to, a human being doing itself
is horrible. What to speak of the idea of God doing something like that? So, in
fact, you know, you know, a few yea..., you know, a year ago or so, there was a
court case in Russia. Where, you know, you know, the ROCs. The Russian Orthodox
Church. You know. Which wants sort to have monopoly on religion in Russia. You
know. Which tried to ban the Hare Krishna. Ban the "Bhagavad-gītā As It Is" of
Srila Prabhupada. And one of the reasons that they gave was this, this kind of
description. They said, they worshi..., these Bha..., these cu..., these people
worship a God who, who, you know, He drinks blood. And eats people. So, this is
a, this is, this is a barbaric cult. And, you know, we should not allow such a
cult to have any presence in In..., in our country. So, that was their argument.
So, actually, this is such a, you know, such a weak and, you know, distorted
argument, you know, without any philosophical context. Actually, if we look at
any scripture. If somebody wants to, you know, distort things out of context.
Then, anywhere and everywhere, that can be, doubt, distortion can be there. You
know. If we, if we look in the Bible. We will find that, especially in the Old
Testament that whenever the kings conquer any kingdom, what do they do? First
thing is that, they go and destroy the idols. Over there, in the temple. Their
idea is these are false Gods. And not only do they destroy the idols. There are
descriptions where, you know, in the Bible, where, say, for example, God, you
know, you know, God tells that this particular tribe is, you know, is a
contamination on the race. And you should not mix this with tribe. Otherwise,
your race will become defiled. 12:20
