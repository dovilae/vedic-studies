Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. Now, we
are in the bhakti section of the Bhagavad Gita. Chapter 7 to 12. Bhagavad Gita
can be divided into three sections. Karma. Bhakti. And Jnana. So, actually, you
know, the full Bhagavad Gita talks about bhakti. But the first six chapters talk
about how, from karma, one can gradually rise to the level of bhakti. And the
last six chapters talk about how, from jnana, one can co..., rise to the level
of bhakti. The middle six chapters focus on bhakti, entirely. You know. So, now,
the Seventh Chapter is "Knowledge of the Absolute". We discussed 7.1 which talks
about how one can by hearing, eventually, come to the level of "mayy
āsakta-manāḥ". So, the first, you know, section, from verses f..., 1 to
Krish..., you know, 12, talks about knowing Krishna fully as the source of the
material and spiritual energies. A source of everything, ultimately. So, you
know, knowing Krishna's glory. And in that, the first section, verses 1 to 3
talk about the glory of kn..., knowing about Krishna. You know. Glory of
knowledge of Krishna. So, let us look at this once again. So, it is the
subsection that we are going through. So, know Krishna in full. That is the
first section. Verses 1 to 12. Within that, the subsection that we are going
through is glory of knowledge about Krishna. That is 1 to 3. And then, we will
have 4 to 7 talking about how Krishna is the source of everything. Material and
spiritual. So, let us look at the verses.

        jñānaṁ te ’haṁ sa-vijñānam
        idaṁ vakṣyāmy aśeṣataḥ
        yaj jñātvā neha bhūyo ’nyaj
        jñātavyam avaśiṣyate

So, "jñānaṁ te ’haṁ sa-vijñānam". So, knowledge and realisation. Both together.
"sa-vijñānam". So, "jñānam" and "vijñānam" are referred to in various places in
the Bhagavad Gita. This combination together. In the Sixth Chapter, we saw
"jñānam", "vijñānam" coming together once in:

        jñāna-vijñāna-tṛptātmā

That was 6.8. And before that, "jñānam" and "vijñānam", this combination has
been together once again in the section where Krishna talks, h..., you know, you
know, how lust is the destroyer of knowledge and realisation. So, that is in
3.41.

        tasmāt tvam indriyāṇy ādau
        niyamya bharatarṣabha
        pāpmānaṁ prajahi hy enaṁ
        jñāna-vijñāna-nāśanam

So, "jñāna" and "vijñāna". This combination comes repeatedly. And this will come
once again in the Ninth Chapter, also. You know, ni..., in 9.1:

        idaṁ tu te guhya-tamaṁ
        pravakṣyāmy anasūyave
        jñānaṁ vijñāna-sahitaṁ
        yaj jñātvā mokṣyase ’śubhāt

So, "jñānaṁ vijñāna-sahitaṁ". So, Krishna will talk about this in multiple
places. And not everywhere the meanings are the same. Although, there are
simi..., there is similarity in the sense of the usage. So, generally, "jñāna"
refers to theoretical. And "vijñāna" refers to realisational or
transformational, hmm, knowledge. Hmm. You know. Here, Prabhupada uses, is, is
th..., i..., the, the slightly different sense. Here, Prabhupada says, "jñānam"
refers to phenomenal knowledge. And "vijñānam" refers to "numinous knowledge".
Now, what is phenomena and numina? These are actually very philosophical terms.
To understand these terms, we have to recognise that philosophy in itself is the
search for a deeper reality that is beyond the normal. What is normal
perceptua..., perceptual? What is? You know. We perceive it. So, phenomena
refers to things as they appear to us. And numina refers to things as they
actually are independent of our sense perception. Now, what is the difference
between the two? See, one of the fundamental insights, while studying spiritual
knowledge is that, actually, not just spiritual knowledge. Studying any s..., 
knowledge in a, studying the world through any methodology in a serious way. One
of the points which comes up is that things are deeper than what they appear to
be. You know. Reality is not as it appears to our eyes. So, even in, you know,
western history, in the his..., western intellectual history, as well, of
course, in Vedic history, the idea has always been that, you know, the way
things appear. And the way, the things actually are, there is a difference. So,
now, the question comes up. We access the world through our senses. So, you
know, if we put aside our sense perception. Then, how can we know things h...,
as they actually are? So, ev..., actually, this is a debate even within western
philosophy. You know. You know. Western philosophy. There is empiricism and
rationalism. So, empiricism refers to, empiricism refers to direct perception.
Empirical knowledge we say. That is an analogy which is acquired through direct
sense perception. And rationalism refers to that which is acquired through
reasoning. So, empiricism and rationalism. These are the two branches of, you
know, western intellectual thought which have come out. And among the two, you
know, both have also had conflicts. Now, in one sense, empiricism is pratyaksha.
And rationalism is anumana. So, now, science originally started with empiric,
from empirical to rational. That means, empirical, Newton observed a fruit.
Now, most people who observed the fruit. What would they do? They just pick
the, about the fruit. Eat and forget about the whole thing. Good the fruit fell
down and I was there. But a thinker, like Newton, he thought, ok, why did this
fruit fall down? And then, after that, one moves to rational. And one tries to,
rationality means we try to s..., you know, s..., cons..., come up with a
logical framework of, you know, conceptua..., conceptual understanding which
helps us make sense of the world around us. So, "jñānaṁ te ’haṁ sa-vijñānam".
So, actually, "jñānaṁ" means things as they are. And "vijñānam", the way
Prabhupada talks about "numina" as things they actually are. Now, that would
roughly correlate, roughly, not accurately, roughly correlate with the western
idea, rationalistic idea that actually, beyond how things appear, there is a
framework. Which we need to understand.

So, the different acharyas give different meanings of "jñānaṁ" and "vijñānam".
M..., some, Visvanatha Chakravarti Thakura, for example, acharyas like him, they
say that "jñānaṁ" refers to the aishvarya. And "vijñānam" refers to the
madhurya. The greatness of God. And the sweetness of God. So, the different
acharyas can give different explanations of this. Like this. But the, anyway,
the important point is not that, you know, you know, what the specific terms
refer to. The important point is that Krishna is telling that there are two
aspects to this knowledge. And both, I will give you. "idaṁ vakṣyāmy aśeṣataḥ".
"aśeṣataḥ". That means I will hold nothing back from you. "yaj jñātvā neha bhūyo
’nyaj". Having acquired this knowledge. "jñātavyam avaśiṣyate". Nothing will
remain to be known. This is quite a gold claim. You know, having acquired this
knowledge, there is nothing more for you to know. How could ma..., anyone make
such a claim? There is nothing more for anyone to know. Actually, that claim is
based on the understanding that ultimately, everything is spiritual reality. And
when it comes from Krishna, it is spiritual. When we know the essential
principles. We know everything in the sense of knowing the principles. The
details are endless. And the details can never be known. We can contrast this
statement in the Bhagavad Gita, you know, there, there is nothing more to be
known with Krishna Himself telling in the Tenth Chapter that actually, you know:

        prādhānyataḥ kuru-śreṣṭha
        nāsty anto vistarasya me

In the Tenth Chapter when describing His "vibhūti"s, Krishna will say that I
will only tell you a, you know, a sample of my glories. My opulences. Because my
glories are endless. And Krishna, Arjuna will also say that, I cannot know, I,
actually, I cannot know your full glories. He says, even, actually, what to
speak of me? Even the devatas. Or the assoc..., a, nobody can:

        na hi te bhagavan vyaktiṁ
        vidur devā na dānavāḥ

Nobody can know you. So, when, you know, when both Krishna, Arjuna has said that
Krishna's glories are unknow..., are entirely unknowa..., are not completely
knowable by anyone. Then, what to sp..., Krishna mean, when He says that you
will know everything. You will know everything. You know. There is nothing left.
That this is talking about principles. Not about details. So, generally, the
Upanishads talk about tattva-traya. Tattva-traya is the three Absolute Truths.
What are the three Absolute Truths? Not three Absolute Truths. Three fundamental
truths of reality. There is jiva. Jagat. And Jagadish. Tattva-Traya, it is
called. So, jiva is the, so, it is consciousness, material nature, and the
ultimate causative principle. You know. So, jiva. Jagat. And Jagadish. It, jiva
is consciousness. Jagat is material nature. Nature. Or matter. As might be used,
as might be the word used in modern philosophical parlance. And then, there is
Jagadish. There is the Absolute Truth. So, m..., that may be called as ultimate
causative principle. Or some other similar word which will be non-specific about
what the nature of that Absolute Tr.., Truth is. So, Krishna is telling over
here, as far as the these principles are concerned, you will understand those
principles completely. And then, there will be nothing more for you to know in
terms of principles. Although, of course, in terms of details, the amount of
knowledge is that one can get is ultimately endless. So, "jñātavyam avaśiṣyate".
There is nothing more to be known. So, now, let us move forward. When we,
Krishna talks one more point about this. "jñātavyam avaśiṣyate". There is
nothing more. Then, you know, you know, we also say that the Bhagavad Gita is
like the graduated level of knowledge. And the Bhagavatam is the postgraduate.
And the Chaitanya Charitamrita is the doctoral level of knowledge. So, again,
the question comes up. What does it mean? You know. If Krishna is telling over
here that there is nothing more to be known. Then, how can we say that
Bhagavatam is a higher knowledge? And Bhag..., you know, and Chaitanya
Charitamrita is still higher knowledge? Actually, there is a progression. To
understand the progression, let us look at the, hmm, hmm, let us look at a few
things here. So, Gita talks about the progression in the Bhagavad Gita,
Bhagavatam, Chaitanya Charitamrita. Which that. The Gita talks about God's
identity. The Bhagavatam talks about God's, you know, activity. And Chaitanya
Charitamrita talks about God's mentality. That means the Bhagavad Gita helps us
understand who is God. So, who is God? You know. Is the Absolute Truth a person
or impersonal? If the Absolute Truth is a person, who is that person? So, Gita
helps us understand who is God. Then, now, in the Bhagavad Gita, you know,
Krishna's pastimes are talked about briefly. 

        janma karma ca me divyam

The glory of those pastimes are talked about. But His specific pastimes are not
explained in detail. So, His activities are described in the Bhagavatam. God's
activity comes in the Bhagavatam. And beyond that is God's heart. God's mind.
You know. What does God think? What does God desire? What does God like or does
not like? So, that is described in the whittling Chaitanya Charitamrita. So,
Krishna feels that He has, He is bereaved that the devotees have missed out.
That the devotees are, you know, that His gopis are relishing a greater nectar
than what He is getting. And therefore, He feels that I have to taste the love
of the gopis. Especially of Radharani. And therefore, Krishna, taking on the
mood of Radharani comes as Caitanya Mahaprabhu. So, this sort of esoteric
seeker, esoteric, you know, insights about the heart of the Lord are described
in the Chaitanya Charitamrita. So, when we tell, say, that there is nothing more
to be known. That essentially, it again talks in terms of principles. But the
details about Krishna are infinite. The, in terms of principles. You know, the
personal, the, the f..., truth that the Absolute Truth is a person. The truth
that Absolute Truth can be attained by bhakti. You know. Truth that, you know,
actually, the Absolute Truth is bhakta-vatsala, bhakta-vatsala. So, there is,
there are fundamental principle truths that are, you know, outlined in the
Bhagavad Gita. But as far as the details are concerned, the details are endless.
And the, it is not that the details are unimportant. Details also illumine
Krishna's glories. And they make remembrance of Krishna more relishable. But the
details come later. What comes initially is the, what comes initially is the
incre..., incremental principles. That means the fundamental principles that
increment our understanding about Krishna gradually. So:

        yaj jñātvā neha bhūyo ’nyaj
        jñātavyam avaśiṣyate

There is nothing more to be known. Now, the acharyas described, we, we, if we
consider "jñānaṁ" and "vijñānam" to be aishvarya and madhurya. Then, Chapter
Seven and Eight give us aishvarya jnana. And Chapter Nine gives us madhurya
jnana. Madhurya Jnana. And both together, Chapters Ten to Twelwe, you know,
gives us that. So:

        jñānaṁ vijñāna-sahitaṁ

Both of them together are present in Chapters Ten and Twelwe. So, we will see
how this happens. How Krishna's sweetness, now, madhurya jnana does not
necessarily, here, we have to understand, then the words again can mean
differently. Madhurya jnana do..., is not necessarily the same as madhurya-rasa
jnana. "madhurya-rasa" is a specific, a conjugal rasa. There are five rasas. And
among them, madhurya is one of the rasas. So, madhurya jnana is not the same as
madhurya-rasa jnana. madhurya-rasa jnana specifically refers to the, you know,
a, not, the, you know, the knowledge of Krishna's conjugal pastimes. Madhurya
jnana in general refer to Krishna's sweetness. As contrasted with His greatness.
So, yes, for i..., you know, madhurya jnana, even Krishna being tied up by
mother Yashoda. That is also madhurya jnana. You know. So, Krishna giving up
His greatness. So that He will be, K..., He fights with His gopas. And He is
defeated by them. That is also madhurya jnana. It is not "madhurya-rasa". But it
is madhurya jnana. So, the Bhagavad Gita may not talk directly much about
"madhurya-rasa". But in the Ninth Chapter, His bhakta-vatsalya, His, you know,
hunger for love. And how devotion is His appetiser. All these things are talked
about. And how He always protects His devotees. So, in that sense, madhurya
jnana is given. And in Tenth, Eleventh, Twelth, both come up. The aishvarya as
well as the madhurya aspect come up. Now, hmm, so, how is the Gita complete? We
discussed this little bit. Complete principles are given. Complete details can
never be given even about to any specific subject. What to speak of the Absolute
Truth? So, tattva-traya is jagad, jiva and jagadisha. Matter. Spirit. And
controller. These three. 'M'. 'S'. 'C'. Matter. Spirit. And controller. These
three are tattva-traya. And the basic outline about, you know, what they are.
And how they interact. That is talked about in this chapter. So, in that sense,
this chapter gives complete knowledge to us. Now, hmm, Prabhupada explains this.
Right at the start of his purport:

"Complete knowledge includes knowledge of the phenomenal world, the spirit
behind it, and the source of both of them. This is transcendental knowledge."

This is transcendental knowledge. What this means is, now, it is interesting,
how can, you know, tr..., we would think that transcendental knowledge would
mean knowledge about the transcendental world. But if, th..., the knowledge is
about the material world, about the phenomenal world, then how can that be
called transcendental knowledge? You know. So, transcendental knowledge does not
necessarily mean only knowledge about the transcendental world. You know. It
also means knowledge that directs our consciousness towards transcendence. So,
the knowledge that is there, if the, if we can see this world and its connection
with the transcendental Absolute Truth. Then, even that knowledge will be called
as transcendental knowledge. Because this, that knowledge is, is, is directing
us towards transcendence. So, you know, or any knowledge which helps us remember
Krishna. And helps us direct our consciousness towards Krishna. You know.
Hel..., helps us, you know, to s..., reveals to us the connection of everything
with Krishna. Helps us to see things in a transcendental light. And in that
sense, it is transcendental knowledge. And Prabhupada also explains in what
sense, you know, we know everything. It is not that we have to know all the
details. Prabhupada quotes the Bha..., you know, the Up..., Ved..., Mudan...,
"Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad". There, it said, in 1.3:

        kasminn u bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavatīti

That means, once when one knows that Absolute Truth. Then, everything else
becomes known. So, this is 7.2. We know Hi..., the Absolute Truth completely. 
So, now, 7.3:

        manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
        kaścid yatati siddhaye
        yatatām api siddhānāṁ
        kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ

So, "manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu". "sahasra" is hundred. Sa..., sorry. "sata" is
hundred. "sahasra" is thousand. So, somebody may say, "sahasra sat pranam".
Hundred pranam. We may say, hun..., hundreds and thousands of obeisances at your
lotus feet. Now, actually, we may say, if "sahasra sat koti dandavat pranam".
But we, we often, when the, meet a person, we are being lazy to offer even one
pranam. So, there is no need to have exaggeration like that to try to, you know,
express our reg..., re..., respects. Even Prabhu..., Pra..., please accept
my humble obeisances. Dandavat Pranam. That is good enough. There is no need for
"sahasra sat koti dandavat pranam" at your holy lotus feet. Sometimes, we use
words in such a way that, you know, if we have that kind of reverence, that is
different. But sometimes, you know, the import of words gets lost when we use it
without a, a, without the appropriate feeling behind those due words. So, here,
Krishna is saying that "sahasreṣu". That among thusands of people:

        manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
        kaścid yatati siddhaye

Very few endeavor for perfection. "siddhaye". "yatati siddhaye". "siddhaye" is
perfection. "yatati" is endeavor. Very few endeavor for perfection. And then:

        yatatām api siddhānāṁ

Among those who endeavor for perfection:

        kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ

Very few actually know me in truth. You know. So, in that sense, what Krishna is
telling over here is that He is down, highlighting the rarity of knowledge about
Him. Why is this knowledge rare? Because, first of all, you know, most people
are caught up in the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, mating and
defending. So, there are materialistic people who are caught, it, up in that.
And unfortunately, there are religious people also get caught up in these
things. How is that? Most religious people, they practice religion as a means
for dharma. You know. As a dharma, artha, kama. Who karma-kanda level. The
specific categories of dharma, artha, kama may not be there in the, in the, say,
Abrahamic religions. You know. These names might not be there. But the pre...,
conception is the same. That actually God's blessings upon us are there when we
get the good things of life. And what are the good things of life? Often, people
think largely in the mater..., in materialistic terms. I get this. I get that. I
get all these materialist things. Then, I am happy. So, "manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu".
"sahasreṣu". That among thousands of people, most people are caught up in, you
know, eating, sleeping, mating, defending. So, even people who are religious,
they use their religion for pursuing eating, sleeping, mating and defending.
And, you know, there is a popular chant to Hanuman Ji. You know:

        tuntoho bala brahmacari muche dedo eknari

So, the chant is that you are our celibate. But please give me a woman. So, this
is, you know, completely at a karma-kanda level. So, of course, you know,
choosing a, an appropriate spouse. You know. Compatible spouse is a, a, is
essential for a good life. Even 22:15
