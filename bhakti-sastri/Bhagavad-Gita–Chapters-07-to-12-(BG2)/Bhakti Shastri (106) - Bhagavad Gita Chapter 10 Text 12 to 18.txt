    prapanna parijataya
    totra vetraika panaye
    jnana mudraya krishnaya
    gitamrita duhe namah

Hare Krishna. Welcome back to the Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We
discussed in the previous class about the Chatur Sloki Bhagavad Gita. And how it
gives the essence of the Gita. Based on its context and its content. You know.
So, the context was how it comes after Krishna has said that I am going to speak
the "paramaṁ vacaḥ". The supreme words. And Arjuna, you know, gives his
understanding. Conclusive understanding after that. And the content, it is, it
covers, sambandha, abhidheya, prayojana. It ho..., shows how jnana is a part of
bhakti. And it is integrated into bhakti. So, let us look at one more aspect of
this jnana. And then, we will move forward to, you know, the next verses. So,
sym..., there is a symbiotic relationship between knowledge and devotion. 10.8
describes knowledge leads to devotion.

    iti matvā bhajante māṁ
    budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ

So, "iti matvā". One who understand this. What does one understand? That Krishna
is the Supr..., you know, source of everything. He is ultimate reality. So,
"bhajante māṁ". "bhāva-samanvitāḥ". Such a person acquires knowledge. And
becomes wholeheartedly devoted to Me. So, here, Krishna is telling that
knowledge will, you know, about Me, will lead to devotion. But then, in the
subsequent verses, 10.8 to, you know, 10.10 and 10.11, what does He say? He
says, you know, you know, devotion will lead to knowledge. So, He says, that if
you, "bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam", if you v..., de..., practice devotional service
to Me. Serve Me with affection. Then, "dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ". That knowledge
will give, and devotion will give knowledge. So, what, how is this going about?
First, Krishna says, knowledge leads to devotion. Then, devotion leads to
knowledge. So, what comes first? Actually, you know, you know, there has to be
some basic philosophical understanding about Krishna. But as we render service,
the knowledge deepens. And the knowledge increases our affection further. And
when we serve with affection, then Krishna gives greater knowledge to us. So,
there is symbiotic relationship between the two. This knowledge, which Krishna
is talking about, both in the beginning and in the end. This is the, got nothing
to do with impersonal jnana. Because the first knowledge, Krishna is talking
about is the knowledge of Krishna's glories. That is:

    ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo
    mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate

You know. You know. You know. You know. I am the source of everything. I am
sustainer of everything. And then, after that, second knowledge that He has
talked about is "buddhi. You know. "buddhi".

    dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ
    yena mām upayānti te

This is also knowledge. Which enables one to come closer to Krishna. Way to
return back to Krishna. So, this is also bhakti, anukula jnana. So, bha...,
either way, Kri..., this knowledge, you know, of how glorious Krishna is. And
knowledge of how to go closer to Krishna. You know. This is not talking about
impersonal jnana. So, bhakti-yoga integrates within it jnana. But it is not
dependent on jnana. It is, bhakti-yoga in and of itself is independent of
jnana. Because bhakti-yoga is an independent process. And in fact, all other
processes depend on bhakti-yoga. So, you know, whatever knowledge is required.
Even when whatever knowledge is acquired. Say, for example, when we are studying
philosophy right now, are we do, doing, following the process of jnana-yoga? No.
We are doing:

    śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ
    smaraṇaṁ ...

We are doing bhakti. So, our purpose is Krishna. Our process is Krishna. And,
you know, the source is also Krishna. That means, the knowledge, we are coming,
getting is not from some impersonal source. It is from Krishna Himself. And
then, our purpose is also not that we want to go to some light beyond Krishna.
It is Krishna. And, you know, you know, our, you know, process is also centered
on Krishna. We are discussing about Krishna. So, in that sense, it is not bhakti
pratikula-jnana. It is bhakti anukula jnana. So, now, after this, Kri..., Arjuna
speaks his, you know, you know, understanding of the essential me..., you know,
message of the Bhagavad Gita. So:

    arjuna uvāca

    paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma
    pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān
    puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam
    ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum

    āhus tvām ṛṣayaḥ sarve
    devarṣir nāradas tathā
    asito devalo vyāsaḥ
    svayaṁ caiva bravīṣi me

So, here, it is described, Arjuna is saying, "paraṁ brahma". So, you are the
Supreme Brahman. Now, the mayavadis and the impersonalists, you know, are very
fond of, you know, you know, speaking the, you know, Vedic aphorism. You know.
"Aham Brahmasmi". It is definitely true. We are Brahman. And this has bee
considered by Shankaracharya as one of the Mahavakyas of the Upanishads. This is
also fine. But then, you know, what is its meaning? It is not saying "Ahaṁ paraṁ
Brahmāsmi". It is simply "Ahaṁ Brahmāsmi". So, I am Brahma. That is definitely
true. But beyond my being Brahma, there is a higher reality. And that higher
reality is the reality of Krishna. Who is the "paraṁ brahma". So, I may say that
I am an Indian. And the Prime Minister of India may also say that my ancestor is
Indian. So, if I say I am an Indian. The Prime Minster is Indian. Therefore, I
conclude I am the Prime Minister. No. That is not correct. There is Brahm..., in
Brahma, also, there is, there is diversity amidst unity. You know. There is in
spiritual level. There is all, you know, you know, the unity of everything is
Brahman. But within that Brahman, there are levels of reality. There is
diversity amidst unity. So, then, "paraṁ", "pavit", "paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma".
"dhāma". "dhāma" means abode. You are the supreme abode. I, as Krishna has told
earlier in the Ninth Chapter.

    mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni

In one sense, everything resides on Him. And then, He is the supr..., so, you
know, in a, in the sense of the mentals of the universe, it, Krishna is
ultimately maintaining everything. Of course, He is not burdened as Krishna
has also stated in Ninth Chapter. When He said:

    na ca mat-sthāni bhūtāni
    
We discussed that inconceivable relationship earlier. You know. But the
important point is that "paraṁ dhāma". He is the ultimate abode. He is ul..., He
i..., He, where, He, He is the, you know, abode for all of us. He is, He is
non-different from His abode. You know. You know. Goloka Vrindavan is once
non-different from Krishna. So, He is there, He want, that is where we want,
want ultimately to go. That is the supreme destination where we will become
happy. And He is also the supreme abode for our hearts' aspirations. You know,
we, we, you know, we pin our hopes on some person. Or some plan. Or something.
We think once I get my own house. Once I get my own car. Once I get that job.
Once I get that spouse. You know. We pin all our hopes on those things. Those
become the abode of our aspirations. Abode of our dreams. But actually, they are
all fallible shelters. They cannot give us permanent solace. That Krishna is
"paraṁ dhāma". So, "pavitraṁ" and "paramaṁ". So, "pavitraṁ paramaṁ" can be seen
as you are, you know, the purest and the greatest. So, "pavitraṁ" is actually,
we have discussed "apāpa-viddham". You know. That:

    asnāviram śuddham apāpa-viddham
    kavir manīṣī paribhūḥ svayambhūr
    yāthātathyato 'rthān vyadadhāc chāśvatībhyaḥ samābhyaḥ
 
So, "apāpa-viddham". "śuddham". Prabhupada had translated as, ant...,
prophylactic and antiseptic in the "Īśopaniṣad". In, you know, Mantra Five. You
know. So, you know, you know, you know, you know, "apāpa-viddham".

    sa paryagāc chukram akāyam avraṇam
    asnāviram śuddham apāpa-viddham

    kavir manīvi...
    r...
    sūḥ...
    parisūḥ...

    kavir manīṣī paribhūḥ svayambhūr

So, actually, this Mantra Eight, Mantra Eight, where it talks about the learned
person understands the Absolute Truth to be supremely pure. So, pure and
purifying. You know. Whatever impurities are there in the past, they will be
removed. And once we have Krishna in the heart, no further impurities will come
in, also. So, in this way, what Krishna is telling over here is, what Arjuna is
saying here about Krishna is that "pavitraṁ". You are pure. The, you are pure.
And "paramaṁ". So, the word "pavitraṁ" indicates that, now, now, Krishna will
not be having any sinful desires like we have. You know. That is not the context
of the word ""pavitraṁ" over here. "pavitraṁ" means, in general, any kind of
contamination. So, even from the view, point of view of transcendence. Even
goodness is a contamination. So, Krishna is uncontaminated by any of the modes.
"paramaṁ". He is the supreme being. "bhavān". So, "bhavān" is a respectful
address. You, oh Lord. You are all this in. So, "puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ". So, the word
"puruṣaṁ" is again, it is a very clear personalist designation. A personalist
reference. So, now, Krishna is clearly telling "bha...", Arjuna is clearly
saying "bhavān". To You, he is saying. He is not saying that, oh, there is some
personal light within You. Which is the supreme reality. He says, no. You are
the "paraṁ brahma". You are. And as if that were not clear enough. Just that
that the two people are standing in front of Vishnu. And having the discussion.
And one is referring to the other. And saying "bhavān". The, and He is also
using the very personal reference. "puruṣaṁ". And what kind of "puruṣaṁ" are
you? "śāśvataṁ". So, it is not that from the impersonal, some light has
manifested from, you know, so, from, you know, the impersonal light, some
personal form has manifested temporarily. No. "śāśvataṁ". You know. You know.
Eternally. This. And "divyam". And this form which you have, you who are my
Lord, You are transcendental. The word "divyam" is the same as Krishna has used
in 4.9. "divyam" for His pastimes. So, you know, you know, you know,
"ādi-devam". So, Krishna has earlier said that:

        aham ādir hi devānāṁ
        maharṣīṇāṁ ca sarvaśaḥ
        
In 9.20, He says, I have come before everyone else. So, He has, Krishna, Arjuna
is saying, yes, You are "ādi-devam". There are many Gods. But You are the
source of all God. And "ajaṁ". So, Kri...:

        yo mām ajam anādiṁ ca
        vetti loka-maheśvaram
        asammūḍhaḥ sa martyeṣu
        sarva-pāpaiḥ pramucyate

So, in 9.3, Krishna had said that, you are, you know, that one who understands
need to be "ajam" and "anādiṁ". That is beyond the dimension of time. Such a
person will become free from all sinful, all sins, will be unbewildered. So,
Krishna, Arjuna is saying the same thing. You are "anādiṁ". "ajam". So, sorry,
you are an "ajam". "ajam anādiṁ ca". So, He is also saying, you are "ajam". And,
you know, "ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum". "vibhum". You are the great. We discussed how
"anu" is used to refer to the jiva. And "vibhum" is used to refer to the Lord.
Now, you know, sometimes, when two friends are discussing. And one friend
speaks a, gives an eloquent speech. The other friend, you know, in just the mood
of, you know, friendly banter. He may say, hey, you are the greatest speaker in
the whole world. He just want to encourage the friend. And even among friends,
there might be some, some exaggeration, also. That is understood. So, is it like
that over here? That Krishna and Arjuna are friends. So, Arjuna just wants to,
you know, the Lord, you know, g..., eulogize even if it is not true. And even if
it involves some exaggerations. So, somebody might argue like that. This is like
this. But actually, you know, the, this discussion, which is happening, is a
very serious discussion. Right in the b..., start of the discussion. When it was
on a casual friend. When it was on, you know, you know, you know, friendly, you
know, front, Krishna did not give any instruction. Krishna says, come on.

        kutas tvā kaśmalam idaṁ

In 2.2 and 3, Krishna said that, ok, do not be, do not be weak-minded. Come on.
Back up. And fight. But then, Arjuna took that discussion to a deeper level by
saying, aha...:

        pṛcchāmi tvāṁ dharma-sammūḍha-cetāḥ

He says, I am going to, I am going, asking you what is "dharma". And, you know,
I am surrendering unto You.

        śiṣyas te ’haṁ śādhi māṁ tvāṁ prapannam

He says, I am becoming your disciple. Instruct me. I am surrendering to You.
"prapannam". So, you know, Arjuna has taken that decision to a very serious
level. And if we look what Krishna has spoken from 2.11 onwards. Till 10.11. You
know. Actually, Krishna is not just having some, you know, friendly chit-chat.
Krishna has a, having very deep philosophical discussion. So, if we look at what
the nature of the discussion. You know. Then, we will understand that this is
not, it, it is most unlikely that it will be just some, you know, insubstantial
exaggeration. But, and, but Krishna, Arjuna, he also speaks something else which
counters this point. He says that, you know, sometimes, we may, so, often, we
may say, oh, my friend, you are the world cricket cha..., you are the world's
best batsman. Now, you know, one friend may say that to another person. But if
that says, you know, that, all the world's best cricket commentators, all the
world's best cricket experts. They all say the same thing. Say, oh, why would
they say the same thing? You know. They do not have to exaggerate. They are
experts in that subject. If they are saying it, then this person must really be
the, among the best batsmen in the world. So, now, Arjuna is saying that this is
not I will be who is saying this. Actually, the great authorities who have
studied the Vedic su..., you know, Vedic subject very exhausted, they are saying 
it. So, that he correlates here by saying that:

        āhus tvām ṛṣayaḥ sarve

"āhus tvām ṛṣayaḥ sarve". You know. The, all the great sages have said this. And
he gives specific names, also.

        devarṣir nāradas tathā

"Nārada" has said this. And:

        asito devalo vyāsaḥ

You know. And "asito devalo vyāsaḥ". Now, among these. "Nārada". And "Vyāsa".
You know. You know. Their names will come again in the same chapter when as the
vibhutis of Krishna.

        devarṣīṇāṁ ca nāradaḥ

Krishna will describe that among the sages, among the, you know, cel...,
celestial seers, I am "Nārada". And:

        munīnām apy ahaṁ vyāsaḥ

You know. Among the great "munī"s, you know, you know, I am "Vyāsa". He is
describing. So, they are also vibhutis of Krishna. The point is, you know, even
Krishna acknowledges their sp..., these, these sages' special position. And, you
know, you know, that is what Arjuna is also, you know, you know, now, so, now,
when Arjuna is quoting them. He is, you know, he is actually quoting very great
people over here. You know. And, now, if we, we study the Mahabharat, there are
many occasions where Arjuna has heard the same thing about Krishna from these
great sages. The Mahabharat is a massive book. Hundred and ten thousand verses.
You know. huge book. In fact, it is the word's longest poem. You know. Not just
the world's longest poem. You know. Before the western world came to know about,
you know, you know, the Mahabharat, you know, India the Northern sea, where
considered to be among the, you know, a longest poems. But the Mahabharat is
seven times longer than both these Germanic sagas. India the Northern sea. It is
massive. And in that Mahabharat, "Nārada" makes his appearances various points.
"Vyāsa" makes his appearance at various points. And they have all spoken the
glories of Krishna at various places. So, Kri..., you know, this is, now,
reading the Mahabharat. Then, Arjuna has also heard about it on various
occasions. So, he is saying, you know, "devarṣīṇāṁ":

        asito devalo vyāsaḥ
        svayaṁ caiva bravīṣi me

And You, Yourself have spoken this. You know. That means that, you know,
Krishna, he is saying, I am saying this. But what is the basis for my saying it?
Actually, it is not, it is not just my understanding. It is what the sages have
said. And it is, it is what you have said just now. So, how does this add to the
authority that You Yourself have said it. Krishna ha..., if Krishna is the
Absolute Truth. And then, He is speaking something, you know, while giving a
philosophical explanation of reality. Then, that has to be taken as an absolute
authority. In fact, Krishna's authority is the ultimate authority. Because He is
the Absolute Truth. So, in this way, you know, you know, you know, Arjuna is
giving the understanding that Krishna is the Absolute Truth. He is personal. He
is transcendental. He is eternal. He is pure. He is, you know, the Supreme
Brahman. And He is the ultimate truth overall. So, this is what Krishna is,
you know, Krishna's discourse had produced this understanding in Arjuna. And
Prabhupada gives various explanations of these terms. And, you know, so,
Prabhupada talks about the obstinate conviction. So, untu..., unfortunately, he
says, you know, you know, being able to understand this by through disciplic
succession. But:

"Unfortunately those proud of their academic education, despite so much evidence
in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that Kṛṣṇa is an
ordinary person."

So, you know, you know, you know, conviction in the right thing is good. You
know. Conviction in the wrong thing becomes obstinacy. And obstinacy can keep us
bound till our grave. And beyond our grave to, in our next lives, also. To, you
know, mistaken believes. So, Krishna is not an ordinary person. And it is only,
it is, you know, unfortunate that if some people are obstinate. You know. There
are evidences that the Vedic literature give. And then, further, there is the
experiential evidence whch we can get, also, if we devote ourselves to Krishna.
So, you know, you know, you know, you know, one time Srila Prabhupada was in a
morning walk. And he asked that devotees. Why do you consider, why do you
consider Krishna to be God? So, Prabhupada would oft..., sometimes, stake the
rule of atheist. So that he would speak. He said, why do you accept Krishna as
God? So, he said, the devotees started, you know, ok, they said that, you know,
Krishna, devotees gave different reasons. You know. The great acharyas have
accepted. Krishna has six opulences. Krishna is all-attractive. Krishna has
sweetness which other, other aspects, the sweetness and Krishna is very
special. So, Prabhupada said no. This is all this, I, so, he says, you know,
ok, if the Veda, the Bhagavad Gita says, you know, I do not belove, believe the
Bhagavad Gita. Prabhupada took the role of an atheists. Then, Prabhupada finally
said that, why do you accept Krishna as God? Prabhupada said, when we chant Hare
Krishna, we experience the ecstasy. 20:03
