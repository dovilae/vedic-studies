Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are
in the Eleventh Chapter. Just about to start off in rev..., viewing through the
Gita's description what is one of the most extraordinary mystical, religious
visions in all of religious histories. You know. In different religious
traditions, there are saints. And seers. Who get visions. So, Mu..., Muhammad is
supposed to have got a vision which took him to, in which he saw, met all the
previous prophets. Jesus. And Abraham. Moses. And Abraham. And he is supposed to
have seen the face of Allah, also. And then, but what actually he saw, when he
saw God is not described in the Quran. Jesus is said to have been the son of
God. And he has been in touch with God. But what he inv..., what were the nature
of those interactions, that is not spoken about much. So, the, you know,
manifestation of God, that is described in this chapter in the Bhagavad Gita has
few parallels. Few, if any parallels in the religious literature of the world.
So, there have been many great saints throughout history who have had
experiences of God. No doubt. But here, the experience is not just an inner
experience. It is an outer vision. And that vision is not just some imagination.
It is a revelation. So, Arjuna is seeing not because of some imagination from
his mind. But it is a revelation that is given by God Himself. So, God is
revealing how He is the universal form. You know. So, what exactly does the
universal form mean? And, you know, how does it, you know, relate with our
normal understanding of various things? We will see this in due course. Let us
look at Arjuna's verses. You know. Let, let us look at the Gita's verses how
they describe this mysterious phenomena. You know. You know. You know. You know.
So, let us look at it from the Bhagavad Gita. Verses 5 onwards. So, here, we
discussed what is happening in this chapter. Let us have a quick overview of
the chapter once again. You know. Verses 1 to 4 was Arjuna's request. Verses 5
to 8 was Krishna's descrip..., is Krishna's description of the universal form.
Then, 9 to 14 is "Sañjaya"'s description of the universal form. Then, after
that, 15 to 31 is Arjuna's description. And then, it moves forward. So, let us
look, start, let us start by looking at Krishna's description of the universal
form. So, we will look at the description. And as we move forward, we will try
to understand the concepts. That are implied by that description.

        sri-bhagavan uvaca

        pasya me partha rupani
        sataso ’tha sahasrasah
        nana-vidhani divyani
        nana-varnakrtini ca

So, "pasya me". You know. See my "rupani". Now, you know, you know, Arjuna had
asked to see the "rūpam aiśvaraṁ". The mysterious form. "rūpam aiśvaraṁ". The
opulence of the form. So, "pārtha rūpāṇi". So, "rūpāṇi" means, here, Arjuna is
being told that there is not just one form. There are many forms in it. You
know. So, actually, is one majestic form, which, which in cohesion. Or in, you
know, you know, synthesis can be called as the universal form. But within that
universal form, there are many, many forms. So, "pasya". So, actually, you know,
this word "pasya" will come several times in this chapter. And, you know,
especially in Krishna's description over here in the next four verses. And the
point is that, Arjuna had desired to see. And Krishna is, see now. Krishna is
saying see. See. So, this is a, as I said, not just an, you know, experience or
a, you know, inner realisation. It is a vi..., visible vision for Arjuna.
"sataso ’tha sahasrasah". "sataso". So, now, actually, how many forms are there?
"sata" is hundreds. "sahasrasah" is thousands. So, in, in that one form, there
are hundreds and thousands of forms. "nana-vidhani divyani". "nana-vidhani".
That there are many different kinds of forms, also. Variegated. And they are
all divine. They are all tri..., they are all extraordinary. They are connected
with God. And "nana-varnakrtini ca". So, "varna" is color. "akrtini" is shape.
So, they are, that means, there is one universal form. But within that, there is
tremendous variety. First of all, there are many forms. Now, all of them, forms
are "div...", "divyā". But then, they are of different colors. They are all
different, you know, shapes. And they are all variegated. So, you know, this is
the mysterious vision that Krishna is revealing to Arjuna. So, normally, when we
see, you know, we do not just see with the eyes. We see with our intelligence.
This is not just a philosophical point. It is also a practical reality. You
know. When we see, we cannot make sense of things unless our intelligence has
some f..., past framework. By which we can make sense of things. You know. There
are two, there are two kinds of blindness. There is congenital blindness. And
there is adventitious blindness. So, congenital is when a person is blind right
from the, you know, birth itself. Adventitious is when that person becomes blind
over a period of time after having had vision for some time. Now, in some cases,
if the cause of the blindness is correctable, then the person who is blind may
be able to get back eyes through surgery. And through other medical treatment.
Now, if the, if the person had been congentally..., congenitally blind. And got
back eyes. Say, the person has been blind for 15 years. 20 years. And then, for
the first time, the surgery is done. And the person gets back eyes. You know.
After that person gets back eyes, there have been, you know, jour..., medical
journal articles. And even books written about this. That these people who are
blind and they got back the eyes back. You know. You know. All that they, when
they opened their eyes, all that they could see, sense was just a confused haze
of light and colors which was also incoherent for them. So, one of those
persons, he describes, when he asks, you know, I just opened my eyes. And I
could just see a bewildering maze of colors. And suddenly, I heard a voice. And
then, I looked in that diretion. And then, I saw a pattern of dark and faint
colors. And, you know, because I knew that voices came from faces. So, I
realised that whatever I was seeing was a face. But I just could not make sense
of it.

So, whether there was a, there was a carpenter, you know, who had used tools.
And all of, and for many, many years, this carpenter had been using tools to cut
wood. Although, he was blind. You know. So, when the first time, he saw a, you
know, you know, saw. You know. A machine for cut..., a, a tool for cutting. You
know. He looked at it. And he looked at it as if he had never seen it, only.
He just could not make sense of it. Although, he had been using it, so, a, for
a, throughout his life for earning a lifehood. But still, it was completely
unfamiliar. And then, as he was looking at it without being able to make any
sense. Then, as soon as movements were unsure. And, and, you know, un...,
unsteady. But then, as soon as he touched, then, immediately, oh, this is the
part. This is the blade part. This is the handle part. He started picking up.
And using it. So, he was able to use it far better with the sense of touch than
with the sense of sight. Why is that? Because, you know, our knowledge proceeds
from the familiar to the unfamiliar. We have something familiar that we know.
And then, something more which connects with the familiar. And that is how our
knowledge proceeds further. But when, you know, there is no framework for our
knowledge. When there is no, you know, you know, nothing familiar whi...,
through which the unfamiliar can launch on, then there is no, you know,
intelligibility in the perception. So, people who are, you know, you know,
congenitally blind. If somehow, they get eyes, they need, you know, a long
period of inculturation. You know. For them to get accustomed. And habituated to
having eyes. And to function with the eyes. It is not easy for them. Why?
Because they just have no prior frame of reference with which to view the world.
So, actually, people see not just with their eyes. They see with their
intelligence. So, the color patterns and the shapes, and everything that we see
with our eyes, if we did not have a prior bank of experience with which through
to connect with view, we would not be able to understand it. So, similarly here,
you know, Arjuna is going to get a vision for which he has no prior connection
to make. Nobody has seen anything like this. And Krishna will also tell, you
know, you know, several times in this chapter, "adṛṣṭa-pūrvāṇi". This has never
been seen before. "adṛṣṭa-pūrvāṇi". So, "dṛṣṭa" is to see. "adṛṣṭa" is not to
see. Not seen. "pūrvāṇi" is in the past. This has never been seen before. So,
therefore, Krishna by these introductory verses is giving Arjuna some basic
framework by which he can, he will be able to, by which Arjuna will be able to
make some sense of what he is going to see now. So, therefore, Krishna is
telling Arjuna. He is orienting Himself. Like when a person gets into a company,
there is an orientation course. So, that person knows what is that. This is the,
this department of the company. This is the, you know, these are the, these are
in charge. This is here. This is here. So, now, Arjuna needs an orientation
course before he can have a perception session. 10:30
