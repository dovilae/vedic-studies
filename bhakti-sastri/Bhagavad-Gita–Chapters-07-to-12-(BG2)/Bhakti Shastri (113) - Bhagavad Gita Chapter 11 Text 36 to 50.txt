    prapanna parijataya
    totra vetraika panaye
    jnana mudraya krishnaya
    gitamrita duhe namah

Hare Krishna. Welcome back to our Bhagavad Gita, Bhakti Shastri course. We are
now going to start with Arjuna's prayers. So, until now, we started with
Arjuna's request. Then, Krishna's description of the universal form. Arjuna's
request was verses 1 to 4. Verses 5 to 8 was Krishna's description of the form
that He was going to reveal. Then, 9 to 14 was "Sañjaya"'s description of the
form that was being shown. Then, 15 to 31 was Arjuna's description of what he
was seeing. We had discussed the division within that, also. Which concluded
with an inquiry. A reverential, fearful inquiry. Who are You? And then, in the
last class, we discussed how, you know, the Lord responded, 32 to 35. He told
him how, you know, become My instrument, essentially. Vi..., your victory is
guaranteed. Act on My behalf. And then, you know, the camera moves backwards.
And now, "Sañjaya" speaks one verse. That now, you know, you know, Kri...,
Arjuna while trembling in fear is speaking verses. So, Arjuna speaks prayers to
the "viśva-rūpa". You know. Eleven prayers. Let us loo..., have an overview of
that. Before we go into those prayers. So, 36 to 46 are the prayers. So, thr...,
first three are glorification. 36 to 38. Then, next two, 39 to 40 are the
offering of obeisances. Then, 41 to 44 is apology. He is begging the Lord.
Forgive me for taking You for granted. For being so intimate to You. And then,
last two, 45 to 46 are request. These are request actually to show the "saumya
rupa". To first show the chaturbhuja rupa. And then, the "dibuja rupa". The
saum..., you know, so, let us look at these one by one. Let us go to 36:

        arjuna uvāca

        sthāne hṛṣīkeśa tava prakīrtyā
        jagat prahṛṣyaty anurajyate ca
        rakṣāṁsi bhītāni diśo dravanti
        sarve namasyanti ca siddha-saṅghāḥ

So, "sthāne hṛṣīkeśa". So, it is rightly done that. "sthāne" means, and ju...,
the "sthāne" means position. So, "sthāne" means at the right position. So, it is
rightly done. Everything is rightly done. What has happened? "hṛṣīkeśa". Oh,
Lord. You are the controller of the senses. So, earlier, Arjuna had not been
able to place what is this particular form? You know. So, the, earlier, we
discussed, he could not identify the "kalarupa". But now, that he has identified
the "kalarupa". Then, he is, you know, now, knowing, ok, this is the same
Vishnu. This is the same Supreme Lord. So, now, he is using familiar describers,
also. "hṛṣīkeśa". "sthāne hṛṣīkeśa tava prakīrtyā". Your glories. What happens
when Your glories are spoken? "jagat prahṛṣyaty anurajyate ca". That the whole
world becomes, whole universe becomes delighted. "jagat prahṛṣyaty". "anurajyate
ca". So, you know, "pra...", you know, "anurajyate". So, actually, two things
happen when we glorify the Lord. We become joyful. And we become attached to the
Lord. And actually, wha..., you know, when we glorify the Lord, these two
results come out naturally. Our joy increases. And our attraction to Him
inclea..., increases. And then, on the other hand, so, this is for those who are
devotionally inclined. Those who are pious-minded. But then, you know, "rakṣāṁsi
bhītāni diśo dravanti". But those who are de..., demoniac-minded. Those who are
"rākṣasa"s. "bhītāni". "bhītāni" means fearfully. "diśo dravanti". They run
away. "dravanti" is to flee. They run away in vari..., di..., you know,
directions. Various directions. And then, "sarve namasyanti ca siddha-saṅghāḥ".
And all the "siddha"s, they are offering obeisances to You. And all this is
rightly done. So, that means, the general people become delighted when the Lord,
you know, Lord's glories are sung. And the demons flee. And the, those who are
saintly, they start pray..., they start offering obeisances. And welcoming the
Lord. And, you know, respect, oh, showing respects to the Lord. So, all this is
appropriately done. Now, what is the point of this verse coming just after this?
You know. Just after the response of the "viśva-rūpa". So, now, Arjuna is able
to make sense of what he had seen. You know. Actually, he saw initially that
actually everybody was "pravasan...", "pravyathitāntar-ātmā". That all the three
"loka-trayaṁ". "pravyathitās tathāham". The word "pravyathitās" is used twice in
the, you know, series of verses from 15 to 31. 20th. And again, I think, 24th
verse. So, "pravyathitaṁ". Disturbed. Disturbed. So, actually, what, he is now
thinking back. And he is saying, actually, when the Lord appears, what happens?
They are typical reactions. Now, those typical reactions may not happen when the
Lord appears in a very fearsome form. So, but in general, this is what happens.
And he says, this, the, the demoniac become fearful. The jub..., you know, the,
the general people become jubilant. And they, series start offering prayers.
This is all "sthāne". This is all rightly done. Actually, there are, in, in the
Vedic, you know, culture, there are different kinds of raksha mantras. So, you
know, you know, there are mantras to protect oneself from bad omens. From ghosts.
Similarly, there are mant..., mantras to protect oneself, protecting oneself
from "rākṣasa"s. So, this verse is a part of the "rākṣasa" raksha mantras. So,
that this is meant to, that, that by speaking this verse, the "rākṣasa"s, you
know, fly. Go away. Then, you know, he further says in the next verse. Every...,
now, everybody is glorifying. So, he says, why should they not glorify? Because
You are ultimately, You are supremely glorious.

        kasmāc ca te na nameran mahātman
        garīyase brahmaṇo ’py ādi-kartre
        ananta deveśa jagan-nivāsa
        tvam akṣaraṁ sad-asat tat paraṁ yat

So, "kasmāc ca te na". "kasmāc". Why should they not? "nameran mahātman".
"nameran" means offer obeisances. "mahātman". Oh, Supreme Lord. Why should they
not offer obeisances to You? Why? "brahmaṇo ’py". "garīyase brahmaṇo ’py
ādi-kartre". So, "garīyase". You are greater than "brahmaṇo". So, the word
"brahmaṇaḥ", you know, we have to be careful at what, what it means at different
places. It can refer to the Brahmanas. It can refer to the Brahman. Brahman. The
brahmayoti. Or it can refer to Brahmaji. So, here, it refers to Brahmaji.
"brahmaṇo ’py ādi-kartre". So, actually, You are greater than "Brahmā", also.
Because "Brahmā" is considered to be a creator. But You are greater than
"Brahmā". You are the Supreme Creator. You are the "ādi-kartre". And "ananta
deveśa jagan-nivāsa". You are "ananta". You are unlimited. You are "deveśa". So,
You are the Lord. You know. The, the controller of all the Gods. Not only are
the controller of the all Gods. But You are the shelter of the whole universe.
And then, he says, "tvam akṣaraṁ sad-asat tat paraṁ yat". "tvam akṣaraṁ". You
are "akṣaraṁ". You are infallible. You are imperishable. "sad-asat tat paraṁ
yat". So, in this world, there are causes and effects. So, causes produce
effects. And effects, you know, become causes for future chain of effects. And
like that, this whole material existence goes on in a chain. But he says, You
are transcendental to all this. You are not mixed up in all this. "tvam akṣaraṁ
sad-asat tat paraṁ yat". You are beyond all this. So, you know, in the first
verse, he said, ok, whatever reactions I am seeing, they are appropriate. And
this verse, he says, yes, You are supremely worshipable. Even for Brahmaji. You
are the shelter of the whole universe. And You are the, transcendental to the
universe. Then, after describing this, he further goes and says. You know. So,
what is happening here? After the, you know, you know, the glor..., first, there
is glorification going on. After the glorification, there will be obeisances
offered. So, we will see now, the obeisances will begin from the next verse.
36-38, three verses are the verses of, you know, glorification.

        tvam ādi-devaḥ puruṣaḥ purāṇas
        tvam asya viśvasya paraṁ nidhānam
        vettāsi vedyaṁ ca paraṁ ca dhāma
        tvayā tataṁ viśvam ananta-rūpa

So, "tvam ādi-devaḥ". You are the original God. "puruṣaḥ purāṇas". You are the
original primeval person. "tvam a...", you know, "tvam asya viśvasya paraṁ
nidhānam". You are the shelter of the whole universe. Supreme shelter. "vettāsi
vedyaṁ ca paraṁ ca dhāma". So, "vettāsi vedyaṁ ca". "vettāsi" means You are the
knower. And You are the knowa..., knowable. You are the person who knows
everything. And You are the person, You have to be known by everyone. You know.
This is interesting relationship. That actually, everything about everyone,
Krishna knows. Because He is omniscient. He is present as Supersoul in the
heart. And "abhijñaḥ svarāṭ".

        ’nvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ svarāṭ

He is directly and indirectly cognizant of everything. So, now, when He is
cognizant of everything directly, what does it imply? It implies that He knows
everything. So, the, "vett...", "vettāsi". So, He is, knows everything. At the
same time, you know, we can know so many things in this world. You know. We can
know about, we can take a mic in front of us. And, you know, somebody can do a
PhD thesis in the mic itself. You know. What should be the composition of the
mic. What should be the angular alignment of the mic. What should be the, you
know, resonance or, what should be the mic's, you know, strength. And so many
things we can, parameters, we can use to try to understand how the ideal mic
should be. And all this knowledge can be useful. But it is not ultimate
knowledge. It is not the knowledge that can grant us, you know, supreme
happiness. It cannot take us out of material existence. So, the only:

        tam eva viditvāti mṛtyum eti
        nānyaḥ panthā vidyate ’yanāya

So, in the Shrutis, it is, says, "tam eva viditvān". Only by know Him, knowing
Him, "āti mṛtyum eti". One goes beyond "mṛtyum". Otherwise, "nānyaḥ panthā
vidyate ’yanāya". Otherwise, there is no path to go, no way to go beyond this.
So, therefore, what happens? You know. So, he is saying, "vettāsi vedyaṁ ca".
So, You are the supreme object to be known. Actually speaking, many objects can
mean, mean, used, can be made objects of knowledge. But none of those know...,
objects of knowledge can benefit us as completely as knowing about Krishna.
"paraṁ ca dhāma". And You are the supreme shelter. And then, "tvayā tataṁ viśvam
ananta-rūpa". "tvayā tataṁ". And You have manifested. By You, the whole universe
is pervaded. "tvayā tataṁ viśvam ananta-rūpa". "tataṁ" is pervaded. "viśvam".
So, You are the, having "ananta-rūpa". It is, so, here, now, it is interesting,
you know, the "viśva-rūpa". So, what does it actually mean? Is that universe
God? The universe is the form of God. So, what does it mean? Is it like this Lord
is the soul? And the universe, Lord is a soul? And the universe is the body of
the Lord? Or what does it mean? So, "tvayā tataṁ viśvam ananta-rūpa". So, it
says "tvayā". By You, the whole universe is pervaded. But then, after then, he
says, "viśva-rūpa". So, actually, "viśvam" is Your "rūpa". So, actually, this
is, in this revelation, the, it is mystical. Is it that the Lord is not just the
soul within the universe? That He is always there. You know. The Supersoul who
is present in our body. That is "Kṣīrodakaśāyī-Viṣṇu". Similarly, the
"Garbhodakaśāyī Vishnu", you know, the Supersoul in the whole universe.
Supersoul of the whole universe. That is always true. But in this particular
form, it is not just that the Lord is pervading everything as the Supersoul.
That is also, that definitely true. "tvayā tataṁ viśvam ananta-rūpa". Yes. You
have pervaded the universe. But then, You are manifesting as this "ananta-rūpa",
also. You are manifesting as this unlimited form. Unlimited form. And then, he
de..., goes on to describe, now, he starts offering obeisances. So, in first
three verses were glorification. Praise. Now, there are obeisances.

        vāyur yamo ’gnir varuṇaḥ śaśāṅkaḥ
        prajāpatis tvaṁ prapitāmahaś ca
        namo namas te ’stu sahasra-kṛtvaḥ
        punaś ca bhūyo ’pi namo namas te

So, "vāyur yamo ’gnir". So, now, here, you know, he is controlling, he is
conveying that, actually, whatever are the manifestations of power in this
world. Ultimately, they are the Supreme Lord. That does not mean that there is
an absolute oneness. But there is a, you know, there is a connection in the
sense that those are the vibhutis of the Lord. And the Lord's power is
manifested through them. So, "vāyur yamo ’gnir". So, wind. Then, you know,
"yamaḥ" is the controller. It can refer to Yamaraja. "’gnir". Fire. "varuṇaḥ
śaśāṅkaḥ". The God of water. Moon. "prajāpatis tvaṁ prapitāmahaś ca". So,
"prajāpatis" refers to, you know, Prabhupada translates it "Brahmā". And the
great-grandfather. So, here, you know, now, he says "namo namas te ’stu
sahasra-kṛtvaḥ". Therefore, "sahasra-kṛtvaḥ". I offer obeisances many, many
times to You. "sahasra-kṛtvaḥ". And after offering obeisances to You again and
again, you know, "sata" is hundred. "sahasra" is thousands. So, thousands of
obeisances are offered to You. And then, because You, all these devatas are
worshipable. But You are the source of the power. And the glory of all the
devatas. So, if you offer obeisances once, twice, thrice to the many devatas. To
the, all the different devatas. If You alone, You are manifested one time, then
we offer obeisances to You, also. So many times. "sahasra-kṛtvaḥ". And even that
is not enough. Therefore, "punaś ca bhūyo ’pi namo namas te". I offer You
obeisances thousands of times. And yet again, I offer You obeisances. And now,
we will describe, normally, when we go to a temple, you know, we will offer
obeisances to the deities. But here, when the, he is offering obeisances
"viśva-rūpa". Where does he offer obeisances? The "viśva-rūpa" is everywhere. If
you look at the front. You will look at the back. You will look at the right.
You will look at the left. So, everywhere, "viśva-rūpa" is there. So, where do
you offer obeisances? So, therefore, he will say in the verse. I offer
obeisances from the front. From the back. From lef..., from all directions, I
offer You obeisances. That is the next ver..., pra..., verse in the prayers.

        namaḥ purastād atha pṛṣṭhatas te
        namo ’stu te sarvata eva sarva
        ananta-vīryāmita-vikramas tvaṁ
        sarvaṁ samāpnoṣi tato ’si sarvaḥ

"namaḥ purastād". "namaḥ purastād" means from the front. "atha pṛṣṭhatas te".
From behind. "atha". So, from front, from behind, I offer obeisances. "namaḥ
purastād atha pṛṣṭhatas te". "namo ’stu te sarvata eva sarva". "namo ’stu te
sarvata". I offer obeisances from all directions to You.
"ananta-vīryāmita-vikramas tvaṁ". "ananta-vīryā". "ananta-vīryā" is Your
strength is unlimited. "amita-vikramaḥ". And "vikramaḥ" is force. The force by
which wonderful things are done. Your force is "amita". It is unlimited.
"āmita-vikramas tvaṁ". So, basically, You are incredibly power. Therefore, I
offer You obeisan..., I offer obeisances from front. From back. From all
directions. Because You are everywhere right now. And "sarvaṁ samāpnoṣi tato ’si
sarvaḥ". You know. So, You are "sarvaḥ". You are everything. But in what sense
are You everything? It is not a simplistic equalisation of everything with God.
He says "sarvaṁ samāpnoṣi". Actually, You pervade everything. And therefore, You
are everything. So, in that sense that everything is an abode for You.
Everything is an arena where You pervade. Therefore, it is that You are
extraordinary. "sarvaṁ samāpnoṣi". "sarvaṁ samāpnoṣi". You pervade everything.
And "tato ’si sarvaḥ". "tato ’si sarvaḥ". Therefore, You are everything. Now,
here, you know, now, Prabhup..., you know, Prabhupada quotes from the "Viṣṇu
Purāṇa " in the verses. He says, you know, 1.6.69:

        yo ’yaṁ tavāgato deva
        samīpaṁ devatā-gaṇaḥ
        sa tvam eva jagat-sraṣṭā
        yataḥ sarva-gato bhavān

So, "yo ’yaṁ tavāgato deva". "tavāgato" means in front of You. Whoever comes.
"samīpaṁ devatā-gaṇaḥ". So, even if he is one of the devatas, that can order be,
human beings when approach You. But even if there is a devata who approaches,
actually, "sa tvam eva jagat-sraṣṭā". You know. You are the creator of the whole
universe. And because You are the creator of the universe. You are creator of
everything. And everyone within the universe. "yataḥ sarva-gato bhavān". And
"sarva-gato bhavān". So, in that sense that, actually, You are all-pervading.
Because You are the creator. And controller of everything. So, You are
all-pervading, also. So, after all these offering obeisances, so, now, Arjuna,
He is thinking, you know, I was, I behaved so intimantely..., intimately with
this Absolute Truth. I treated Him like a friend. So, now, he is offering
obei..., apologies.

        sakheti matvā prasabhaṁ yad uktaṁ
        he kṛṣṇa he yādava he sakheti
        ajānatā mahimānaṁ tavedaṁ
        mayā pramādāt praṇayena vāpi

        yac cāvahāsārtham asat-kṛto ’si
        vihāra-śayyāsana-bhojaneṣu
        eko ’tha vāpy acyuta tat-samakṣaṁ
        tat kṣāmaye tvām aham aprameyam

So, "sakheti matvā". I thought of You as friend. And "prasabhaṁ". "prasabhaṁ"
means that was presumptuous on my part to do like this. "sakheti matvā prasabhaṁ
yad uktaṁ". "prasabhaṁ yad uktaṁ". So, "uktaṁ". I, I presumptuously addressed
You as what? "he kṛṣṇa he yādava he sakheti". "he kṛṣṇa he yādava he sakheti".
So, I addressed You as, oh, "Kṛṣṇa". Oh, "Sakha". Oh, "Yādava". So, Visvanatha
Chakravarti Thakura explains that what is the meaning of this? He says that,
actually, you know, you know, you know, I thought that I, I am a member of the
ruling dynasty. I am a king. But you are not a, the king. You are simply a, a
member of the royal family. You know. "Ugrasena" is the king. Your grandson and
you are just one member among the many "yadus". So, actually, I have done a
favor to you by befriending you. That is how I was thinking. You know. "he
kṛṣṇa". You know. So, I would say, You are, you are not Yaduraja. You are not,
you know, the, you know, you are the greatest among the "yadus". You are just
one of the yadus. "he kṛṣṇa he yādava". So, oh, Krishna, You are "Yādava".
Actually, I thought that I have done a favor to you by making you a "sakha".
Because I was un..., I was a great, I thought that I am a greater ksatriya than
You. So, you know, you know, he says, actually, this was such a terrible error
of m..., judgement from me. What was it? "ajānatā mahimānaṁ tavedaṁ". "ajānatā".
I did not know. "mahimānaṁ tavedaṁ". Your glory, I did not know. And then, "mayā
pramādāt praṇayena vāpi". So, when I spoke this, what, what, when I, I thou...,
thought of myself as superior to You. And I spoke presumptuously to You. What
was the reason for such presumptuous behavior? He, he says, he says, it could be
"pramādāt". It could be "praṇayena". "pramādāt" means it could be madness. It
could be love. So, here, when, you know, Arjuna is, you know, you know,
apologising to the Lord. He is not making another presumption of claiming that I
love You. He says, love is a possibility. It could be madness, also. Whatever it
is, he says I beg forgiveness from You. So, here, we see that the rasa is
changing. We generally do not see that in the sakhya-rasa in Vrindavan, ever,
the gopas apologising to Krishna. You know. Their relationship were very close.
They tease Krishna. They wrestle with Krishna. Sometimes, they defeat Krishna,
also. So, actually, in the Gopala Champu, Jiva Goswami describes that after
Krishna defeated all the wrestlers of Kamsa. You know. He defeated, h...:

        musti kasura chanurah
        malla yuddha visaratah

All those who were malla-yuddha visaratah. In wrestling, they were all experts.
And He defeated all of them. So, after defeating them, you know, some of them
were destroyed. Some of them, f..., remaining fled. Then, Krishna called all His
friends on the, you know, on the wrestling arena. And He wrestled with them. And
just to increase the waxation of, you know, Kamsa, Krishna was defeated by His
wrestling friends. By the gopas in wrestling, Krishna was defeated. He says, oh.
Kamsa was mortified. He said, you know, my trained champion wrestlers, they were
killed by those children. And these children are defeated by other children.
What is going on over here? So, we, the, actually, the "sakhya-rasa" of the, you
know, you know, of vrajavasis, is called as visrambha sakhya. It is very
intimate sakhya. So, you know, their sakhya is very rarely, if ever, you know,
covered over by knowledge of Krishna's divinity. For them, Krishna is just a
lovable child among them. So, whereas Arjuna, now, he is actually praying to the
Lord. Offering obeisances. Bowing down. And seeking abs..., seeking forgiveness.
So, this is called as "gaurava-sakhya". Where this awe, awareness of the
greatness of the person. There is "gaurava-sakhya". There is "visrambha sakhya".
So, this is "visrambha sakhya". Which is the vrajasis exhibit. So, Arjuna is
exhibiting here "gaurava-sakhya". Now, of course, from our point of view, is,
sakhya itself is a very exalted platform. So, these sort of, you know, subtle
differences are just to understand how, how, you know, you know, relishable and,
and intricate the, and intimate. Not intricate. Intimate. The relationships in
Vrindavan are. But overall, the point is, here, that Arjuna is offering
obeisances. And begging forgiveness. And then, he is, further describes. You
know. What was so bad? It was not just that I addressed You with derision in my
mind. But actually, even in the pre..., even other times, also. "yac
cāvahāsārtham asat-kṛto ’si". "cā". "yac cā". Along with that, "hāsārtham". For
the sake of joking, what did I do? "asat-kṛto ’si". "asat-kṛto". That means I
acted improperly. So, what was that? You know. "vihāra-śayyāsana-bhojaneṣu".
So, "vihāra". So, they were friends. So, sometimes, they would lay down
together. "vihāra-ś...". They would play together. "śayyāsana-bhojaneṣu". They
would sit together. They would take food together. So, at that time, what would
happen? "eko ’tha vāpy acyuta tat-samakṣaṁ". So, sometimes, in, you know, we,
when we are alone, I spoke, you know, teasingly to You. I made fun of You. I
derided You. Of course, it is all out of love. But then, you know, you know,
sometimes, I devou..., I did it even in the presence of others. You know.
Sometimes, when friends meet, there can be, there can be little banter. You
know. Just friendly talk. Light talk. There may be teasing. There may be mutual
joking. And fun over there. But at other times, there are other kinds of talks,
also. Which will, which will be much more serious. "yac cāvahāsārtham asat-kṛto
’si". "asat-kṛto ’si". This is, what I spoke was not appropriate. "eko ’tha vāpy
acyuta tat-samakṣaṁ". So, You are "acyuta", my dear Lord. I can comm..., I am
not, I am not "acyuta". I can commit mistakes. You do not commit mistakes. So,
You please forgive me for my mistakes. "tat-samakṣaṁ". "tat kṣāmaye...", you
know, you know, "tat kṣāmaye tvām aham aprameyam". So, "tat kṣāmaye tvām".
Please forgive me. I ask "kṣāmaye" for that. So, Arjuna, you know, you know,
when he understands how great his friend is. And how powerful is, he is thinking
that actually I have acted erroneously. I have acted grievously by talking so
intimately with Krishna. So, please forgive me.  "tat kṣāmaye tvām". So, after
requesting Arjuna to forgive, then he is now further, Ar..., giving the rationale
why You should forgive. So, he is saying:

        pitāsi lokasya carācarasya
        tvam asya pūjyaś ca gurur garīyān
        na tvat-samo ’sty abhyadhikaḥ kuto ’nyo
        loka-traye ’py apratima-prabhāva

So, "pitāsi lokasya carācarasya". So, You are the father of all the world. And
in the world, You are the father of the "cara". And the "acara". Of the moving.
And the nonmoving. Everyone. You know. "tvam asya pūjyaś ca gurur garīyān". So,
"pūjyaś ca". "pūjyaś" means worshipable. "tvam asya pūjyaś ca gurur garīyān".
So, You are more worshipable. You are the most worshipable among all worshipable
people. "garīyān". You know. Glorious. "na tvat-samo ’sty". There is no one
equal to You. Therefore, "abhyadhikaḥ kuto ’nyo". Where can there be anyone
greater than You? So, he is saying how foolish I was? To think that You are just
a "Yādava"? And I am greater than You? It is, that is such an absurd idea I had.
He says, actually, nobody can even be equal to You. How can somebody be superior
to You? So, and then, he says "loka-traye ’py apratima-prabhāva". In fact, Your
"prabhāva". Your power. Your influence. It is "apratima". It has actually no
comparison. No parallel. He is, Prabhupada translates that, You are immeasurably
powerful. Oh, immeasurable power. "loka-traye ’py". Actually, there is no
comparison. Not just on earth. But in all the three worlds. We see, now, the
"Virata rupa" is pervading all the vi..., all the vision. All the lokas. All, 
everything is included within Him now. So, His power is far greater than
anyone's else power. So, here, he is saying, the implication will be that,
actually, you know, it is a mistake that I am a child. So, "pitāsi". You are the
"pitā". You are the "pitā". I am the child. So, please forgive me. So, now,
Prabhupada quotes some verses to establish how, actually, the "na tvat-samo ’sty
abhyadhikaḥ kuto ’nyo". So, there is no one equal to or superior than Him. Now,
so, "na tvat-samo ’sty abhyadhikaḥ kuto ’nyo". So, actually, if nobody can be
equal. How can anyone be superior to Him? So, Prabhupada quotes from
"Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad" for that.

        na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate
        na tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate

So, the first is not directly related. He does not do any work. But second is,
"na tat-samaś". There is nobody equal to Him. "cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate". Nowhere
can we see anyone greater than Him. And then, Prabhupada quotes from the Gita,
also. The famous verse. "tatt...", "vetti tattvataḥ". We should know Him in
truth. You know. And then, therefore, now he concludes his request for, you
know, apolo..., apolo..., for forgiveness with a, with obeisances. And with an
example of how, the, three examples in fact of how within intimacy things can be
forgiven.

        tasmāt praṇamya praṇidhāya kāyaṁ
        prasādaye tvām aham īśam īḍyam
        piteva putrasya sakheva sakhyuḥ
        priyaḥ priyāyārhasi deva soḍhum

So, "tasmāt praṇamya". Therefore, I offer obeisances to You. "praṇidhāya kāyaṁ".
"praṇidhāya kāyaṁ". That means I will lay down and offer obeisances to You.
"prasādaye tvām aham īśam īḍyam". "prasādaye tvām". Have mercy on me, my dear
Lord. "aham īśam īḍyam". You are the "īśam". You are the controller. You are the
most worshipable person. "īḍyam". "prasādaye tvām". You know. So, You are
worshipable. You are controller. And You can forgive me. So, I offer obeisances.
I bow down to You. Please forgive me. And then, he gives two examples. Three
examples. "piteva putrasya". So, and whenever there is intimacy, earlier, he
says that, here, said that, "mayā pramādāt praṇayena vāpi". So, I, it could be
my, either be or, maddness, out of love. So, now, Arjuna is telling, actually,
it was out of love. And in love, how sometimes, you know, there can be some
intimate speak. Speech. Which is not to be considered offensive. So, he gives
examples. "piteva putrasya". That just a fath..., just a father, you know, when
the son speaks, the son behaves slightly inappropriately with the father. The
father forgives. "sakheva sakhyuḥ". So, just as when there are friends closer
you. And friends may taint each other. May tease each other. And that is, also,
you know, forgive, they forgive each other. And then, "priyaḥ priyāyārhasi deva
soḍhum". "priyaḥ". "priyāyāḥ". So, actually, when, you know, you know, very
loving husband and wife are there. So, at that time, you know, you know, the
lover forgives the beloved. So, the beloved may speak within, within love. The
Lord may get angry. And chastise. Speak strong words. So, at that time. Or
speak, you know, in, in the lo..., intimacy of love, may speak, you know, you
know, in a teasing way. So, the, you know, if somebody else could have spoken
that. So, for example, you know, in love, somebody says. You know. You are a
rascal. You know. You are a rascal. Now, the word is strong. But as spoken with
love, so the, you know, so the emotion, so, of the, there is actually no anger
over there. You know. Somebody says angrily, I love you. You know. The very
words are, say, I am angry with you. And I love you has no meaning when said
like that. Isn't it? So, you know, actually, sometimes, even within love, when
there are some, some inappropriate words spoken, actually, the, the love is so
great that the inappropriate words, you know, do not matter. And we overlook
those inappropriate words. Because we see the heart that is there. Generally
speaking, when there is love. There is trust. And when there is trust, then, you
know, you know, then, you know, one sees the intentions beyond the actions. And
even if the actions, actions are not proper, one sees the intentions. And one
understands. Yes. Ok. That person actually meant well. But somehow, some words
came out wrong at that time. Some actions went out wrong, went out, went wrong.
So, generally speaking, we see the good intentions. And overlook the bad
int..., bad actions. When there is trust. But when there is no trust, at that
time, even when there are good actions, we wonder what are the intentions.
Maybe, this person is doing some flattery. You know. This person is doing sick
offenses. So, that person can extract something out of me. So, at that time,
when the person, when, even if the person does good actions, when there is no
trust, then everything in the relationship is like walking in a landmine. You
know. When we are, if we are walking in an area, on a war field or somewhere
where we suspect, these enemy may have put some mines. So, just put one step.
And boom. Or there might be a big explosion. And in my, our leg might be blown
off. Or even our head might be blown off. Disasters can occur.

So, actually speaking, when the, you know, you know, trust level is low among
people, at that time, one just does not see, one, ev..., one, everything is
suspect. So, bad actions, immediately, we infer. Oh, this person, you know,
wants to put me down, only. And bad actions, immediately, we infer there must be
bad intentions. And we do not, you know, take into f..., account at all the fact
that there might be accidental, you know, accidentally wrong, wrong actions that
might have happened. We just assume. Bad actions. Ah, there must be bad. I knew
that person, only. That person hates me. That is why that person does like this.
And then, even when there are good actions. Then, what happens is, one still
suspects. What is the, there must be some ulterior motive. So, here, he is
saying, actually, but when there is love, in love, naturally, there are actually
good actions, only. You know. When a, two people love each other. Then, they
speak sweetly. They behave kindly. They care for each other. But at times, you
know, you know, when there is a love. And sometimes, there is a bad action, that
is also forgiven. So, he is saying, out of love, my dear Lord, please forgive
me. We, even if I had spoken inappropriately. Just as a son forgives, you know,
just as parents forgives the f..., son. Just as, you know, you know, friend
forgives the friend. Just as a lover forgives the beloved. Similarly, please
forgive me. You know. So, now, in one sense, these may seem like the three
rasas: vatsalya, sakhya and madhurya. They seem to be. The last two are similar.
But the first is not. In vatsalya, the Lord is the son. The Lord is a ch..., and
the devotee is the parent. But here, it is saying. This is a father forgive the
son. So, this is the, first part is the opposite of vatsalya. So, here, he is
talking about the normal, you know, in the western religions. To the large
extent, this idea is there. And it is not alien to the Indian religious
tradition, also. It is also there. You know. That, also that the idea is that
God is the father. And we are his chidlren. So, "priyaḥ priyāyārhasi deva
soḍhum". So, like this, my dear Lord. "deva soḍhum". Please tolerate whatever I
may have done wrong. And forgive me. Forgive me. So, "kṣāmaye tvām", we have
talked in an earlier verse. Now, he is emphasising, please forgive, my dear
Lord. So, as devotees, you know, whenever possible, you know, we should act upon
a positive way. And by positive, you know, positive actions, by positive, you
know, you know, pos..., interactions, then we create trust, good trust level.
And when there is good trust level. Then, even if there are accidental slips, we
understand, ok, this is just accidental. It does not matter so much. And we keep
moving forward in our spiritual life. "adṛṣṭa". So, now, in, you know, now, he
is, now, the, actually, the next two verses, he is making a request. These two
prayers. Let us look at those prayers.

        adṛṣṭa-pūrvaṁ hṛṣito ’smi dṛṣṭvā
        bhayena ca pravyathitaṁ mano me
        tad eva me darśaya deva rūpaṁ
        prasīda deveśa jagan-nivāsa

So, "deveśa jagan-nivāsa". This part had come earlier, also. "prasīda". You
know. You are, you know, the Lord of the Gods. And "jagan-nivāsa". You are the
shelter of the universe. But here, the context is slight..., "adṛṣṭa-pūrvaṁ".
So, earlier, in the, you know, while, in Arjuna, in Krishna's self-description
of what he is going to see, is the first time, the word "adṛṣṭa-pūrvāṇi" had
come. That this is never, this what you are going to see is, nobody has seen
this. Now, Arjuna is repeating that. Yes, Krishna. What You have showed me is,
it is extraordinary. It is some, not just extraordinary. It is unique. You have
not showed this to anyone. "adṛṣṭa-pūrvaṁ hṛṣito ’smi dṛṣṭvā". "hṛṣito ’smi
dṛṣṭvā". "hṛṣito" means actually, you know, to see things that You have giv...,
You have bestowed such a grea..., extraordinary, unparallel, unique mercy on me.
And You have revealed so..., something so rare. And special to me. I am so, I am
"hṛṣito ’smi dṛṣṭvā". You know. I am seeing this "hṛṣito". I am becomi..., I have
become jubilant. I am delighted. I am engladdened. But the same time, "bhayena
ca pravyathitaṁ mano me". Actually, still, my mind is, you know, by fear, it is
"bhayena". "pravyathitaṁ". It is tormented. So, why is it tormented? Why is it
tormented? Because, you know, yes, seeing this "kalarupa". And in this
"kalarupa", things were so fearsome. So deadly. Seeing all the blood coming out.
The heads getting smashed. The blood being leaked. And the teeth coming out. And
it is so, so phew, it is gruesome form. So, "bhayena ca pravyathitaṁ mano me".
So, you know, you know, earlier, he had said, actually, when the fir..., before
the "kalarupa" was seen, the, the "viśva", "viśva-rūpa" was being seen. 37:41
