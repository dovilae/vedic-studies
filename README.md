Vedic Studies

I have found the following motivations behind this project:

* Eliminate accent issues to make the content easier for some people to comprehend.

* The facilitator may speak too slow, fast, quiet or loud to be understood.
While one can speed up, slow down and adjust the volume on videos, it may not be
the best solution as the voice may be distorted, not loud enough, etc.
Distortion can event make the hearing and understanding worse.

* Finding reference easier by simple text search rather than playing video back
and forth. This is also good for preaching after finishing the courses.

* Easier to find sanskrit and bengali recitations when the text is present,
especially for people not familiar with those languages. Also, the facilitator
does not always mention which scripture, chapter, verse, etc, these references
are coming from. But it is easy to search for text to find the origin.

* Not often, but sometimes, the video and the audio are out of sync. This is not
the best experience. The text will not have this issue.

* Some people can read faster than watching videos.

* Sometimes, the grammar is not correct in the video and this can be fixed in
the text. It is difficult to fix the video due to the technology that it was
created with several years ago.

* Rarely, there are factual mistakes in the class, which can be easily corrected
in text form. But again, not so much in the videos and technology that was used
for creating them. This needs to be done carefully and probably with
authorisation.

* Rarely, the slides haves typos on them.

* Our ears can simply be used for other things, if need to, while reading these
notes. This is also called as multitasking. 

* Internet connection is not always available.

* Some people may just wish to store this knowledge on disk. In this case, text
will consume less space on the hard disk than videos.

Having said that, all credit goes to Chaitanya Charan Prabhuji's classes. They
are extremely valuable asset in the Vedic fold, especially those studying for
Bhakti Shastri.

It has taken me about one hour to transcribe ten minutes manually. So, it is
about 1200 hours to transcribe the Bhakti Shastri modules. It is a lot of work.
If you know any good software that could aid this process, that would be great
to hear. I have tried Google Voice and some other solutions to no avail. They
produced poor output where I ended deleting nearly all what they have generated.
So, I have decided to do these manually until someone can offer me a better
solution.
