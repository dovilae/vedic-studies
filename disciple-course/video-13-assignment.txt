Describe your vision of what ISKCON would be like, if devotees maintained
positive and co-operative relationships between all ISKCON Gurus and disciples

This cooperative, mutually respectful spirit is the best way to preserve the
Society's unity, please Srila Prabhupada, and expand the sankirtana mission.

1. This would keep the institution together. Srila Prabhupada will be pleased.

        "Your love for me" said Srila Prabhupada, "will be shown by how much you 
        cooperate to keep this institution together after I am gone."

        Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta Volume 6, 52: "I have done my part"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. We must be combined together in unity. Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who is Krishna
himself, would be pleased.

        United we stand; divided we fall.

        Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself wanted our cooperation. He is God, Krsna.
        And therefore cooperation is very important thing. Nobody should think
        that "I have got so great ability. I can do." No. It is simply by
        cooperation we can do very big thing. "United we stand; divided we
        fall." This is our... So be strong in pushing on Krsna Consciousness,
        and Krsna will help. He is the strongest. Still, we must be combined
        together.

3. Krishna would also be so pleased with our mutual friendships and our
engagement in devotional service.

        The Lord said: My dear sons of the King, I am very much pleased by the
        friendly relationships among you. All of you are engaged in one
        occupation - devotional service. I am so pleased with your mutual
        friendship that I wish you all good fortune. Now you may ask a
        benediction of Me.

                Pracinabarhisat

guru-shishyaparampara through proper self-development, proper loving
relationships, and meaningful service contribution to all living beings.

5. We would follow proper etiquette in case some disagreement arises.

6. Thus cooperation will be blossoming and Srila Prabhupada, previous acaryas,
