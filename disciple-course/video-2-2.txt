Now let us discuss two types of gurus. First is diksha guru, is only one person who
gives instruction...

Types of Gurus:

* Diska-guru (One)
  - Gives instruction
  - Initiates and officiates connection to Parampara
  - Gives spiritual name
  - Gives mantra (mantra-guru)
  (This also refers to Gayatri, specifically)
  - Accepts disciple vows
  - Removes disciples sinful reactions (at initiation)

* Siksa-guru (Many)
  - Gives instruction
  (and they also help us to remove the burden of huge conditionings that we may be carring from our previous background)

This important quote tells us that it is we, who choose our spiritual master. It
is not that some authority, some friend devotee told us that this is your guru
and you should accept him. That is not the way. One has to carefully select
one's Guru by one's own discretion and the primary qualification for such
selection is hearing. The more we hear and regularly associate with the
initiating spiritual master that we are aspiring from, we get conviction over a
period of time that here is a person who represents Krishna for me most
perfectly.

Here are some sources from where we can have a siksha-guru:

* The senior disciples of the initiating spiritual masters

* Book distributors

* Counsellors

* Various types of Bhakti Vriksha leaders

* Other diksha-gurus

* Of course, Srila Prabhupada is the prominent and preeminent siksa-guru in ISKCON

* and anyone who has taught us any facet of devotional service can also be considered siksa-guru and given respect us

Now, this particular paragraph that we studied, has certain important
considerations. How much role siksa-guru plays in delivering a disciple. There
is a need for healthy dependence on siksa and we will see some examples. We have
the example of Krishna Kavijara Das Gosvami. He had accepted siksa from
Nityananda Prabhu, but he always sings "Rupa Ragunatha Padhe Rahu Mora As".
Because he accepts Rupa Ragunatha as his siksa-gurus. We also have the example
of Bhaktivinoda Thakura. He had his diksa-guru, BB Bihari Goswami, but he
accepted from Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaja and other individuals who he
considered in the role of his siksa-gurus.

Then, we also have Srila Prabhupada's books. One of the reasons why Srila
Prabhupada has written these books, because he also wanted to extend himself as
the siksa-guru for all the generations to come in ISKCON.

What is diksa?

Divya-jnana refers to the process of spiritual knowledge being disseminated to the
disciple. ... That which eradicates completely the sinful activities and
tendencies of a disciple, and especially the sinful reactions that he has
accumulated in his past lives. This process is called diksa. Here is a quote.
