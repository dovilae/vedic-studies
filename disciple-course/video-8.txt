Lesson 8

Guru-puja.

In this lesson, we will cover

1. How we should conduct regular worship of Srila Prabhupada
2. The importance of Guru-puja
3. How we should worship formally other ISKCON Gurus and
4. How we should conduct their Vyasa Puja.

In scriptures, there are many descriptions of the importance of Guru-Puja. We
daily sing in Gurv-astaka prayers.

        saksad-dharitvena samasta-sastrair
        uktas tatha bhavyata eva sadbhih

        Sri Sri Gurv-astaka Verse 7

The spiritual master is honored as much as the Supreme Lord because he is the
most confidential servitor of the Lord.

In Padma Purana, this is a beautiful statement by Lord Siva:

        aradhananam sarvesam visnor aradhanam param
        tasmat parataram devi tadiyanam samarcanam

        From Padma Purana, Caitanya-caritamrta, Madhya 11.31

My Dear Devi, although the Vedas recommend worship of demigods, the worship of
Lord Vishnu is the topmost. However, above the worship of Lord Vishnu is the
rendering of service to Vaishnavas who are related to Lord Vishnu.

In Adi Purana, Lord Krishna is telling Arjuna:

        ye me bhakta-janah partha na me bhaktas ca te janah
        mad-bhaktanam ca ye bhaktas te me bhakta-tama matah

        From Adi Purana, Caitanya-caritamrta, Madhya 11.28

Those who are my direct devotees are actually not my devotees, but those are the
devotees of my servants are factually my devotees.

This goes to show how important it is that we worship and serve the devotees of
the Supreme Lord.

It is not some self-aggrandizement; it is real teaching...

Guru-Puja.

=== List some of the benefits of regular Guru-puja ===

Possible answers could be that:

1. We build our relationship with our spiritual master and by daily remembering
him and his qualities and activities and instructions, we learn how to orient
our life and our thoughts in Krishna Consciousness.

2. It is a wonderful means to express one's gratitude and recommit oneself on a
daily basis to following the Guru's mission.
