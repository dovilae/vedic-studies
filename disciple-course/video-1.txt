Hare Krishna. Welcome.

ISKCON Disciple Course is a training programme, which is meant to help you deepen
your understanding of guru-tattva, guru-padasraya, taking shelter of a guru,
within the multiguru system or culture of ISKCON.

It is designed for new devotees who are about to take initiation, but especially
also recommended for leaders, preachers, counsellors, educators in ISKCON.

This ISKCON Discple Course is based on the teachings of Srila Prabhupada and
also the current ISKCON Law and it has been extensively using the references of
writings of previous acaryas.

The devotees who have designed this course, headed by HG Anottama Prabhu, are
very keen and especially all the GBCs and all the guru vrinda of ISKCON, they
are very keen that this knowledge be made house-hold knowledge and that every
single disciple within ISKCON gets to know about the contents and applications
of these fundamental aspect of guru-disciple relationship.

Let me begin by asking you a question.

=== What does being a good disciple mean to you? ===

(in ISKCON and initiated disciple should be ... now fill in the blank)
(The possible answers could be)

He should perfectly represent, learn and practice the mood and mission of Srila
Prabhupada.

He must be exemplary in character, a perfect gentleman, as Prabhupada called it.

He must do some practical seva responsibly.

He must have healthy relationship with other devotees, his seniors, his equals,
his juniors, especially with other gurus' disciples.

He must be very accountable to his spiritual master, his temple president, his
senior vaishnavas, and he must perpetuate parampara through preaching, book
distribution, harinam sankirtan and other wonderful services that Srila
Prabhupada has offered us in ISKCON.

He must put Srila Prabhupada in the center of ISKCON. He should not too much
promote one's own guru.

He must be appreciative, non-envious, helpful to other ISKCON members.

He should not be doing any backbiting, rumourmongering, controversy making, and he should be focused in achieving the seven goals of ISKCON as given by Srila Prabhupada. Remain united with other of his ISKCON family members.

Especially, initiation should not mean that "oh, I have my guru", but it should
also mean that I have responsibility towards Srila Prabhupada and ISKCON.

Seven purposes of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness

and Srimad-Bhagavatam.
